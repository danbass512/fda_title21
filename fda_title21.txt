Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent
rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent
broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters
which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued
on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16..............................................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27 .................................................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41 ..................................................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50 .............................................................as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44
U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text
of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues
of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date
(in this case, April 1, 2012), consult the ‘‘List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),’’
which is issued monthly, and the ‘‘Cumulative List of Parts Affected,’’ which
appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists
will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any
given rule.
EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for
the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal
Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the
actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cutoff date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective
date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following
the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96–511) requires Federal agencies
to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as
close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
OBSOLETE PROVISIONS
Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on the cover
of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in
effect on a given date in the past by using the appropriate numerical list of
sections affected. For the period before January 1, 2001, consult either the List
of CFR Sections Affected, 1949–1963, 1964–1972, 1973–1985, or 1986–2000, published
in eleven separate volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ‘‘List
of CFR Sections Affected’’ is published at the end of each CFR volume.
‘‘[RESERVED]’’ TERMINOLOGY
The term ‘‘[Reserved]’’ is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal
Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a ‘‘[Reserved]’’ location at any time. Occasionally ‘‘[Reserved]’’ is used editorially to indicate that
a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established
by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register
must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C.
552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force
of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register
will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR
part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to
afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in
accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any
problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing
that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not
available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives
and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or
call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate
volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR INDEX AND FINDING AIDS.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR
titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of ‘‘Title 3—The President’’ is carried within that volume.

Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 170.3 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter,
the following definitions apply:
(a) Secretary means the Secretary of
Health and Human Services.
(b) Department means the Department
of Health and Human Services.
(c) Commissioner means the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
(d) As used in this part, the term act
means the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act approved June 25, 1936, 52
Stat. 1040 et seq., as amended (21 U.S.C.
301–392).
(e)(1) Food additives includes all substances not exempted by section 201(s)
of the act, the intended use of which
results or may reasonably be expected
to result, directly or indirectly, either
in their becoming a component of food
or otherwise affecting the characteristics of food. A material used in the production of containers and packages is
subject to the definition if it may reasonably be expected to become a component, or to affect the characteristics,
directly or indirectly, of food packed in
the container. ‘‘Affecting the characteristics of food’’ does not include such
physical effects, as protecting contents
of packages, preserving shape, and preventing moisture loss. If there is no
migration of a packaging component
from the package to the food, it does
not become a component of the food
and thus is not a food additive. A substance that does not become a component of food, but that is used, for example, in preparing an ingredient of the
food to give a different flavor, texture,
or other characteristic in the food,
may be a food additive.

Subpart B—Food Additive Safety
170.20 General principles for evaluating the
safety of food additives.
170.22 Safety factors to be considered.
170.30 Eligibility for classification as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).
170.35 Affirmation of generally recognized
as safe (GRAS) status.
170.38 Determination of food additive status.
170.39 Threshold of regulation for substances used in food-contact articles.

Subpart C—Specific Administrative Rulings
and Decisions
170.45 Fluorine-containing compounds.
170.50 Glycine (aminoacetic acid) in food for
human consumption.
170.60 Nitrites and/or nitrates in curing premixes.

§ 170.3

21 CFR Ch. I (4–1–12 Edition)

(2) Uses of food additives not requiring
a listing regulation. Use of a substance
in a food contact article (e.g., foodpackaging or food-processing equipment) whereby the substance migrates,
or may reasonably be expected to migrate, into food at such levels that the
use has been exempted from regulation
as a food additive under § 170.39, and
food contact substances used in accordance with a notification submitted
under section 409(h) of the act that is
effective.
(3) A food contact substance is any substance that is intended for use as a
component of materials used in manufacturing, packing, packaging, transporting, or holding food if such use is
not intended to have any technical effect in such food.
(f) Common use in food means a substantial history of consumption of a
substance for food use by a significant
number of consumers.
(g) The word substance in the definition of the term ‘‘food additive’’ includes a food or food component consisting of one or more ingredients.
(h) Scientific procedures include those
human, animal, analytical, and other
scientific studies, whether published or
unpublished, appropriate to establish
the safety of a substance.
(i) Safe or safety means that there is
a reasonable certainty in the minds of
competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use. It is impossible in the present state of scientific
knowledge to establish with complete
certainty the absolute harmlessness of
the use of any substance. Safety may
be determined by scientific procedures
or by general recognition of safety. In
determining safety, the following factors shall be considered:
(1) The probable consumption of the
substance and of any substance formed
in or on food because of its use.
(2) The cumulative effect of the substance in the diet, taking into account
any chemically or pharmacologically
related substance or substances in such
diet.
(3) Safety factors which, in the opinion of experts qualified by scientific
training and experience to evaluate the
safety of food and food ingredients, are
generally recognized as appropriate.

(j) The term nonperishable processed
food means any processed food not subject to rapid decay or deterioration
that would render it unfit for consumption. Examples are flour, sugar, cereals, packaged cookies, and crackers.
Not included are hermetically sealed
foods or manufactured dairy products
and other processed foods requiring refrigeration.
(k) General recognition of safety shall
be determined in accordance with
§ 170.30.
(l) Prior sanction means an explicit
approval granted with respect to use of
a substance in food prior to September
6, 1958, by the Food and Drug Administration or the United States Department of Agriculture pursuant to the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
the Poultry Products Inspection Act,
or the Meat Inspection Act.
(m) Food includes human food, substances migrating to food from foodcontact articles, pet food, and animal
feed.
(n) The following general food categories are established to group specific related foods together for the purpose of establishing tolerances or limitations for the use of direct human
food ingredients. Individual food products will be included within these categories according to the detailed classifications lists contained in Exhibit
33B of the report of the National Academy of Sciences/National Research
Council report, ‘‘A Comprehensive Survey of Industry on the Use of Food
Chemicals Generally Recognized as
Safe’’ (September 1972), which is incorporated by reference. Copies are available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal

§ 170.6 Opinion letters on food additive status.
(a) Over the years the Food and Drug
Administration has given informal
written opinions to inquiries as to the
safety of articles intended for use as
components of, or in contact with,
food. Prior to the enactment of the
Food Additives Amendment of 1958
(Pub. L. 85–929; Sept. 6, 1958), these
opinions were given pursuant to section 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which reads in
part: ‘‘A food shall be deemed to be
adulterated if it bears or contains any
poisonous or deleterious substance
which may render it injurious to
health’’.
(b) Since enactment of the Food Additives Amendment, the Food and Drug
Administration has advised such inquirers that an article:
(1) Is a food additive within the
meaning of section 201(s) of the act; or
(2) Is generally recognized as safe
(GRAS); or
(3) Has prior sanction or approval
under that amendment; or
(4) Is not a food additive under the
conditions of intended use.
(c) In the interest of the public
health, such articles which have been
considered in the past by the Food and
Drug Administration to be safe under
the provisions of section 402(a)(1), or to
be generally recognized as safe for
their intended use, or to have prior
sanction or approval, or not to be food
additives under the conditions of intended use, must be reexamined in the
light of current scientific information
and current principles for evaluating
the safety of food additives if their use
is to be continued.
(d) Because of the time span involved, copies of many of the letters in
which the Food and Drug Administration has expressed an informal opinion
concerning the status of such articles
may no longer be in the file of the Food
and Drug Administration. In the absence of information concerning the
names and uses made of all the articles
referred to in such letters, their safety
of use cannot be reexamined. For this
reason all food additive status opinions
of the kind described in paragraph (c)
of this section given by the Food and

§ 170.10 Food additives in standardized foods.
(a) The inclusion of food ingredients
in parts 170 through 189 of this chapter
does not imply that these ingredients
may be used in standardized foods unless they are recognized as optional ingredients in applicable food standards.
Where a petition is received for the
issuance or amendment of a regulation
establishing a definition and standard
of identity for a food under section 401
of the Act, which proposes the inclusion of a food additive in such definition and standard of identity, the provisions of the regulations in this part
shall apply with respect to the information that must be submitted with
respect to the food additive. Since section 409(b)(5) of the Act requires that
the Secretary publish notice of a petition for the establishment of a food-additive regulation within 30 days after
filing, notice of a petition relating to a
definition and standard of identity
shall also be published within that
time limitation if it includes a request,
so designated, for the establishment of
a regulation pertaining to a food additive.
(b) If a petition for a definition and
standard of identity contains a proposal for a food-additive regulation,

and the petitioner fails to designate it
as such, the Commissioner, upon determining that the petition includes a
proposal for a food-additive regulation,
shall so notify the petitioner and shall
thereafter proceed in accordance with
the regulations in this part.
(c) A regulation will not be issued allowing the use of a food additive in a
food for which a definition and standard of identity is established, unless its
issuance is in conformity with section
401 of the Act or with the terms of a
temporary permit issued under § 130.17
of this chapter. When the contemplated
use of such additive complies with the
terms of a temporary permit, the food
additive regulation will be conditioned
on such compliance and will expire
with the expiration of the temporary
permit.

(b) If intended for use in animals
other than laboratory research animals
and if the edible products of the animals are to be marketed as food, permission for the marketing of the edible
products as food has been requested by
the sponsor, and authorization has
been granted by the Food and Drug Administration in accordance with § 511.1
of this chapter or by the Department of
Agriculture in accordance with 9 CFR
309.17, and it bears a label which states
prominently, in addition to the other
information required by the Act, the
warning:
Caution. Contains a new food additive for
use only in investigational animals. Not for
use in humans.
Edible products of investigational animals
are not to be used for food unless authorization has been granted by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration or by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

§ 170.15 Adoption of regulation on initiative of Commissioner.
(a) The Commissioner upon his own
initiative may propose the issuance of
a regulation prescribing, with respect
to any particular use of a food additive,
the conditions under which such additive may be safely used. Notice of such
proposal shall be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER and shall state the reasons for the proposal.
(b) Action upon a proposal made by
the Commissioner shall proceed as provided in part 10 of this chapter.

(c) If intended for nonclinical laboratory studies in food-producing animals,
the study is conducted in compliance
with the regulations set forth in part 58
of this chapter.

§ 170.18 Tolerances for related food additives.
(a) Food additives that cause similar
or related pharmacological effects will
be regarded as a class, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as
having additive toxic effects and will
be considered as related food additives.
(b) Tolerances established for such
related food additives may limit the
amount of a common component that
may be present, or may limit the
amount of biological activity (such as
cholinesterase inhibition) that may be
present or may limit the total amount
of related food additives that may be

that is itself ready to eat, and which
contains a higher residue than allowed
for the raw agricultural commodity,
may not be legalized by blending or
mixing with other foods to reduce the
residue in the mixed food below the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity.

Subpart B—Food Additive Safety
§ 170.20 General principles for evaluating the safety of food additives.
(a) In reaching a decision on any petition filed under section 409 of the
Act, the Commissioner will give full
consideration to the specific biological
properties of the compound and the
adequacy of the methods employed to
demonstrate safety for the proposed
use, and the Commissioner will be
guided by the principles and procedures
for establishing the safety of food additives stated in current publications of
the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council. A petition
will not be denied, however, by reason
of the petitioner’s having followed procedures other than those outlined in
the publications of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research
Council if, from available evidence, the
Commissioner finds that the procedures used give results as reliable as,
or more reliable than, those reasonably
to be expected from the use of the outlined procedures. In reaching a decision, the Commissioner will give due
weight to the anticipated levels and
patterns of consumption of the additive
specified or reasonably inferrable. For
the purposes of this section, the principles for evaluating safety of additives
set forth in the abovementioned publications will apply to any substance
that may properly be classified as a
food additive as defined in section
201(s) of the Act.
(b) Upon written request describing
the proposed use of an additive and the
proposed experiments to determine its
safety, the Commissioner will advise a
person who wishes to establish the
safety of a food additive whether he believes the experiments planned will
yield data adequate for an evaluation
of the safety of the additive.

§ 170.19 Pesticide chemicals in processed foods.
When pesticide chemical residues
occur in processed foods due to the use
of raw agricultural commodities that
bore or contained a pesticide chemical
in conformity with an exemption
granted or a tolerance prescribed under
section 408 of the Act, the processed
food will not be regarded as adulterated so long as good manufacturing
practice has been followed in removing
any residue from the raw agricultural
commodity in the processing (such as
by peeling or washing) and so long as
the concentration of the residue in the
processed food when ready to eat is not
greater than the tolerance prescribed
for the raw agricultural commodity.
But when the concentration of residue
in the processed food when ready to eat
is higher than the tolerance prescribed
for the raw agricultural commodity,
the processed food is adulterated unless
the higher concentration is permitted
by a tolerance obtained under section
409 of the Act. For example, if fruit
bearing a residue of 7 parts per million
of DDT permitted on the raw agricultural commodity is dried and a residue
in excess of 7 parts per million of DDT
results on the dried fruit, the dehydrated fruit is adulterated unless the
higher tolerance for DDT is authorized

generally available data and information. An ingredient not in common use
in food prior to January 1, 1958, may
achieve general recognition of safety
only through scientific procedures.
(2) A substance used in food prior to
January 1, 1958, may be generally recognized as safe through experience
based on its common use in food when
that use occurred exclusively or primarily outside of the United States if
the information about the experience
establishes that the use of the substance is safe within the meaning of
the act (see § 170.3(i)). Common use in
food prior to January 1, 1958, that occurred outside of the United States
shall be documented by published or
other information and shall be corroborated by information from a second,
independent source that confirms the
history and circumstances of use of the
substance. The information used to
document and to corroborate the history and circumstances of use of the
substance must be generally available;
that is, it must be widely available in
the country in which the history of use
has occurred and readily available to
interested qualified experts in this
country. Persons claiming GRAS status for a substance based on its common use in food outside of the United
States should obtain FDA concurrence
that the use of the substance is GRAS.
(d) The food ingredients listed as
GRAS in part 182 of this chapter or affirmed as GRAS in part 184 or § 186.1 of
this chapter do not include all substances that are generally recognized
as safe for their intended use in food.
Because of the large number of substances the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to
result, directly or indirectly, in their
becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of food, it is
impracticable to list all such substances that are GRAS. A food ingredient of natural biological origin that
has been widely consumed for its nutrient properties in the United States
prior to January 1, 1958, without known
detrimental effects, which is subject
only to conventional processing as
practiced prior to January 1, 1958, and
for which no known safety hazard exists, will ordinarily be regarded as
GRAS without specific inclusion in

§ 170.22 Safety factors to be considered.
In
accordance
with
section
409(c)(5)(C) of the Act, the following
safety factors will be applied in determining whether the proposed use of a
food additive will be safe: Except where
evidence is submitted which justifies
use of a different safety factor, a safety
factor in applying animal experimentation data to man of 100 to 1, will be
used; that is, a food additive for use by
man will not be granted a tolerance
that will exceed 1⁄100th of the maximum
amount demonstrated to be without
harm to experimental animals.
§ 170.30 Eligibility for classification as
generally
recognized
as
safe
(GRAS).
(a) General recognition of safety may
be based only on the views of experts
qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of substances directly or indirectly added to
food. The basis of such views may be either (1) scientific procedures or (2) in
the case of a substance used in food
prior to January 1, 1958, through experience based on common use in food.
General recognition of safety requires
common knowledge about the substance throughout the scientific community knowledgeable about the safety
of substances directly or indirectly
added to food.
(b) General recognition of safety
based upon scientific procedures shall
require the same quantity and quality
of scientific evidence as is required to
obtain approval of a food additive regulation for the ingredient. General recognition of safety through scientific
procedures shall ordinarily be based
upon published studies which may be
corroborated by unpublished studies
and other data and information.
(c)(1) General recognition of safety
through experience based on common
use in food prior to January 1, 1958,
may be determined without the quantity or quality of scientific procedures
required for approval of a food additive
regulation. General recognition of safety through experience based on common use in food prior to January 1,
1958, shall be based solely on food use
of the substance prior to January 1,
1958, and shall ordinarily be based upon

sanction status pursuant to this review
shall be handled pursuant to §§ 170.35,
170.38, and 180.1 of this chapter. Affirmation of GRAS status shall be announced in part 184 or § 186.1 of this
chapter.
(f) The status of the following food
ingredients will be reviewed and affirmed as GRAS or determined to be a
food additive or subject to a prior sanction pursuant to § 170.35, § 170.38, or
§ 180.1 of this chapter:
(1) Any substance of natural biological origin that has been widely consumed for its nutrient properties in the
United States prior to January 1, 1958,
without known detrimental effect, for
which no health hazard is known, and
which has been modified by processes
first introduced into commercial use
after January 1, 1958, which may reasonably be expected significantly to
alter the composition of the substance.
(2) Any substance of natural biological origin that has been widely consumed for its nutrient properties in the
United States prior to January 1, 1958,
without known detrimental effect, for
which no health hazard is known, that
has had significant alteration of composition by breeding or selection after
January 1, 1958, where the change may
be reasonably expected to alter the nutritive value or the concentration of
toxic constituents.
(3) Distillates, isolates, extracts, and
concentration of extracts of GRAS substances.
(4) Reaction products of GRAS substances.
(5) Substances not of a natural biological origin, including those for
which evidence is offered that they are
identical to a GRAS counterpart of
natural biological origin.

(6) Substances of natural biological
origin intended for consumption for
other than their nutrient properties.
(g) A food ingredient that is not
GRAS or subject to a prior sanction requires a food additive regulation promulgated under section 409 of the act
before it may be directly or indirectly
added to food.
(h) A food ingredient that is listed as
GRAS in part 182 of this chapter or affirmed as GRAS in part 184 or § 186.1 of
this chapter shall be regarded as GRAS
only if, in addition to all the requirements in the applicable regulation, it
also meets all of the following requirements:
(1) It complies with any applicable
food grade specifications of the Food
Chemicals Codex, 2d Ed. (1972), or, if
specifically indicated in the GRAS affirmation regulation, the Food Chemicals Codex, 3d Ed. (1981), which are incorporated by reference, except that
any substance used as a component of
articles that contact food and affirmed
as GRAS in § 186.1 of this chapter shall
comply with the specifications therein,
or in the absence of such specifications,
shall be of a purity suitable for its intended use. Copies may be obtained

(2) It performs an appropriate function in the food or food-contact article
in which it is used.
(3) It is used at a level no higher than
necessary to achieve its intended purpose in that food or, if used as a component of a food-contact article, at a
level no higher than necessary to
achieve its intended purpose in that article.
(i) If a substance is affirmed as GRAS
in part 184 or § 186.1 of this chapter with
no limitation other than good manufacturing practice, it shall be regarded
as GRAS if its conditions of use are not
significantly different from those reported in the regulation as the basis on

any interested person may review the
data and information and/or file comments with the Division of Dockets
Management. Copies of all comments
received shall be made available for examination in the Division of Dockets
Management’s office.
(3) The Commissioner will evaluate
all comments received. If he concludes
that there is convincing evidence that
the substance is GRAS as described in
§ 170.30, he will publish a notice in the
FEDERAL REGISTER listing the substance as GRAS in part 182, part 184, or
part 186 of this chapter, as appropriate.
(4) If, after evaluation of the comments, the Commissioner concludes
that there is a lack of convincing evidence that the substance is GRAS and
that it should be considered a food additive subject to section 409 of the Act,
he shall publish a notice thereof in the
FEDERAL REGISTER in accordance with
§ 170.38.
(c)(1) Persons seeking the affirmation
of GRAS status of substances as provided in § 170.30(e), except those subject
to the NAS/NRC GRAS list survey (36
FR 20546; October 23, 1971), shall submit
a petition for GRAS affirmation pursuant to part 10 of this chapter. Such petition shall contain information to establish that the GRAS criteria as set
forth in § 170.30 (b) or (c) have been met,
in the following form:
(i) Description of the substance, including:
(a) Common or usual name.
(b) Chemical name.
(c) Chemical Abstract Service (CAS)
registry number.
(d) Empirical formula.
(e) Structural formula.
(f) Specifications for food grade material, including arsenic and heavy
metals. (Recommendation for any
change in the Food Chemicals Codex
monograph should be included where
applicable.)
(g) Quantitative compositions.
(h) Manufacturing process (excluding
any trade secrets).
(ii) Use of the substance, including:
(a) Date when use began.

which the GRAS status of the substance was affirmed. If the conditions
of use are significantly different, such
use of the substance may not be GRAS.
In such a case a manufacturer may not
rely on the regulation as authorizing
the use but must independently establish that the use is GRAS or must use
the substance in accordance with a
food additive regulation.
(j) If an ingredient is affirmed as
GRAS in part 184 or § 186.1 of this chapter with specific limitation(s), it may
be used in food only within such limitation(s) (including the category of
food(s), the functional use(s) of the ingredient, and the level(s) of use). Any
use of such an ingredient not in full
compliance with each such established
limitation shall require a food additive
regulation.
(k) Pursuant to § 170.35, a food ingredient may be affirmed as GRAS in part
184 or § 186.1 of this chapter for a specific use(s) without a general evaluation of use of the ingredient. In addition to the use(s) specified in the regulation, other uses of such an ingredient
may also be GRAS. Any affirmation of
GRAS status for a specific use(s), without a general evaluation of use of the
ingredient, is subject to reconsideration upon such evaluation.
(l) New information may at any time
require reconsideration of the GRAS
status of a food ingredient. Any change
in part 182, part 184, or § 186.1 of this
chapter shall be accomplished pursuant
to § 170.38.

Commissioner is unaware of any such
applicable prior sanction, the proposed
regulation will so state and will require any person who intends to assert
or rely on such sanction to submit
proof of its existence. Any regulation
promulgated pursuant to this section
constitutes a determination that excluded uses would result in adulteration of the food in violation of section
402 of the Act, and the failure of any
person to come forward with proof of
such an applicable prior sanction in response to the proposal will constitute a
waiver of the right to assert or rely on
such sanction at any later time. The

§ 170.39 Threshold of regulation for
substances used in food-contact articles.
(a) A substance used in a food-contact article (e.g., food-packaging or
food-processing equipment) that migrates, or that may be expected to migrate, into food will be exempted from
regulation as a food additive because it
becomes a component of food at levels
that are below the threshold of regulation if:
(1) The substance has not been shown
to be a carcinogen in humans or animals, and there is no reason, based on
the chemical structure of the substance, to suspect that the substance is
a carcinogen. The substance must also
not contain a carcinogenic impurity or,
if it does, must not contain a carcinogenic impurity with a TD50 value based
on chronic feeding studies reported in
the scientific literature or otherwise
available to the Food and Drug Administration of less than 6.25 milligrams
per kilogram bodyweight per day (The
TD50, for the purposes of this section, is
the feeding dose that causes cancer in
50 percent of the test animals when
corrected for tumors found in control
animals. If more than one TD50 value
has been reported in the scientific literature for a substance, the Food and
Drug Administration will use the lowest appropriate TD50 value in its review.);
(2) The substance presents no other
health or safety concerns because:
(i) The use in question has been
shown to result in or may be expected
to result in dietary concentrations at
or below 0.5 parts per billion, corresponding to dietary exposure levels
at or below 1.5 micrograms/person/day
(based on a diet of 1,500 grams of solid
food and 1,500 grams of liquid food per
person per day); or
(ii) The substance is currently regulated for direct addition into food, and
the dietary exposure to the substance
resulting from the proposed use is at or
below 1 percent of the acceptable daily
intake as determined by safety data in

the daily dietary concentration resulting from the proposed use of the substance. These data should be in the
form of:
(i) Validated migration data obtained
under worst-case (time/temperature)
intended use conditions utilizing appropriate food simulating solvents;
(ii) Information on the amount of the
substance used in the manufacture of
the food-contact article; or
(iii) Information on the residual level
of the substance in the food-contact article. For repeat-use articles, an estimate of the amount of food that contacts a specific unit of surface area
over the lifetime of the article should
also be provided. (In cases where data
are provided only in the form of manufacturing use levels or residual levels
of the substance present in the foodcontact article, the Food and Drug Administration will calculate a worstcase dietary concentration level assuming 100 percent migration.) A detailed description of the analytical
method used to quantify the substance
should also be submitted along with
data used to validate the detection
limit.
(iv) In cases where there is no detectable migration into food or food
simulants, or when no residual level of
a substance is detected in the food-contact article by a suitable analytical
method, the Food and Drug Administration will, for the purposes of estimating the dietary concentration, consider the validated detection limit of
the method used to analyze for the substance.
(5) The results of an analysis of existing toxicological information on the
substance and its impurities. This information on the substance is needed
to show whether an animal carcinogen
bioassay has been carried out, or
whether there is some other basis for
suspecting that the substance is a carcinogen or potent toxin. This type of
information on the impurities is needed to show whether any of them are
carcinogenic, and, if carcinogenic,
whether their TD50 values are greater
than 6.25 milligrams per kilogram
bodyweight per day in accordance with
paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(6) Information on the environmental
impact that would result from the pro-

posed use of the substance. The request
should contain either a claim for categorical exclusion as specified in § 25.32
of this chapter or an environmental assessment as specified in § 25.40 of this
chapter.
(d) Data to be reviewed under this
section shall be submitted to the Food
and Drug Administration’s Office of
Premarket Approval (HFS–200), 5100
Paint Branch Pkwy., College Park, MD
20740.
(e) The Food and Drug Administration will inform the requestor by letter
whether the specific food-contact application is exempt from regulation as
a food additive or not. Although a substance that migrates to food at a level
that results in a dietary concentration
at or below the threshold of regulation
will not be the subject of a regulation
published in the FEDERAL REGISTER
and will not appear in the Code of Federal Regulations, the Food and Drug
Administration will maintain a list of
substances exempted from regulation
as food additives under this section on
display at the Division of Dockets
Management. This list will include the
name of the company that made the request, the chemical name of the substance, the specific use for which it has
received an exemption from regulation
as a food additive, and any appropriate
limitations on its use. The list will not
include any trade names. This list will
enable interested persons to see the
types of uses of food-contact materials
being exempted under the regulation.
Interested persons may also obtain a
copy of the list of exempted substances
by contacting the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Premarket Approval (HFS–200), 5100 Paint Branch

with the Food and Drug Administration’s Freedom of Information Act procedures, as described in part 20 of this
chapter. In particular, data and information that fall within the definitions
of a trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information are
not available for public disclosure in
accordance with § 20.61(c) of this chapter.
(f) If the request for an exemption
from regulation as a food additive is
not granted, the requestor may submit
a petition to the Food and Drug Administration for reconsideration of the
decision in accordance with the provisions of § 10.33 of this chapter.
(g) If the Food and Drug Administration receives significant new information that raises questions about the dietary concentration or the safety of a
substance that the agency has exempted from regulation, the Food and Drug
Administration may reevaluate the
substance. If the Food and Drug Administration
tentatively
concludes
that the information that is available
about the substance no longer supports
an exemption for the use of the foodcontact material from the food additive regulations, the agency will notify
any persons that requested an exemption for the substance of its tentative
decision. The requestors will be given
an opportunity to show why the use of
the substance should not be regulated
under the food additive provisions of
the act. If the requestors fail to adequately respond to the new evidence,
the agency will notify them that further use of the substance in question
for the particular use will require a
food additive regulation. This notification will be placed on public display at
the Division of Dockets Management
as part of the file of uses of substances
exempted from regulation as food additives. The Food and Drug Administration recognizes that manufacturers
other than those that actually made a
request for exemption may also be
using exempted substances in food-contact articles under conditions of use
(e.g., use levels, temperature, type of
food contacted, etc.) that are similar to
those for which the exemption was
issued. Because only requestors will be
notified as part of the revocation process described in this section, the Food

and Drug Administration plans to notify other manufacturers by means of a
notice published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of its decision to revoke an exemption issued for a specific use of a
substance in a food contact article.

§ 170.50 Glycine (aminoacetic acid) in
food for human consumption.
(a) Heretofore, the Food and Drug
Administration has expressed the opinion in trade correspondence that glycine is generally recognized as safe for
certain technical effects in human food
when used in accordance with good
manufacturing practice; however:

(1) Reports in scientific literature indicate that adverse effects were found
in cases where high levels of glycine
were administered in diets of experimental animals.
(2) Current usage information indicates that the daily dietary intake of
glycine by humans may be substantially increasing due to changing use
patterns in food technology.
Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration no longer regards glycine and
its salts as generally recognized as safe
for use in human food and all outstanding letters expressing sanction for
such use are rescinded.
(b) The Commissioner of Food and
Drugs concludes that by May 8, 1971,
manufacturers:
(1) Shall reformulate food products
for human use to eliminate added glycine and its salts; or
(2) Shall bring such products into
compliance with an authorizing food
additive regulation. A food additive petition supported by toxicity data is required to show that any proposed level
of glycine or its salts added to foods for
human consumption will be safe.
(c) The status of glycine as generally
recognized as safe for use in animal
feed, as prescribed in § 582.5049 of this
chapter, remains unchanged because
the additive is considered an essential
nutrient in certain animal feeds and is
safe for such use under conditions of
good feeding practice.

(b) Nitrites and/or nitrates, when
packaged separately from flavoring
and seasoning in curing premixes, may
continue to be used under prior sanctions in the commercial curing of meat
and meat products and poultry products and in accordance with the provisions of §§ 172.170 and 172.175 of this
chapter that apply to meat curing
preparations for the home curing of
meat and meat products, including
poultry and wild game. To assure safe
use of such ingredients the labeling of
the premixes shall bear instructions to
the user that such separately packaged
ingredients are not to be combined
until just prior to use. Encapsulating
or coating some or all of the ingredients does not constitute separate packaging.

information described in § 170.101.
(2) An FCN may incorporate by reference any information in FDA’s files
provided that the manufacturer or supplier is authorized to reference the information. The FCN must include information establishing that the manufacturer or supplier is authorized to
reference information in FDA’s files.
(3) Any material submitted in or referenced by an FCN that is in a foreign
language must be accompanied by an
English translation verified to be complete and accurate.
(b) FDA may choose not to accept an
FCN for either of the following:

§ 170.60 Nitrites and/or nitrates in curing premixes.
(a) Nitrites and/or nitrates are food
additives when combined in curing premixes with spices and/or other flavoring or seasoning ingredients that
contain or constitute a source of secondary or tertiary amines, including
but not limited to essential oils, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate,
hydrolysates of animal or plant origin
(such as hydrolyzed vegetable protein),
oleoresins of spices, soy products, and
spice extractives. Such food additives
may be used only after the establishment of an authorizing food additive

Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with
respect to lllll

erowe on DSK2VPTVN1PROD with CFR

(Name of the food additive and proposed use)
Attached hereto, in triplicate (quadruplicate, if intended uses include use in meat,
meat food product, or poultry product), and
constituting a part of this petition are the
following:
A. The name and all pertinent information
concerning the food additive, including
chemical identity and composition of the
food additive, its physical, chemical, and biological properties, and specifications prescribing the minimum content of the desired
component(s) and identifying and limiting
the reaction byproducts and other impurities. Where such information is not available, a statement as to the reasons why it is
not should be submitted.
When the chemical identity and composition of the food additive is not known, the
petition shall contain information in sufficient detail to permit evaluation regarding
the method of manufacture and the analytical controls used during the various stages
of manufacturing, processing, or packing of
the food additive which are relied upon to establish that it is a substance of reproducible
composition. Alternative methods and controls and variations in methods and controls
within reasonable limits that do not affect
the characteristics of the substance or the
reliability of the controls may be specified.
If the food additive is a mixture of chemicals, the petition shall supply a list of all
substances used in the synthesis, extraction,
or other method of preparation, regardless of
whether they undergo chemical change in
the process. Each substance should be identified by its common English name and complete chemical name, using structural formulas when necessary for specific identification. If any proprietary preparation is used
as a component, the proprietary name should

be followed by a complete quantitative
statement of composition. Reasonable alternatives for any listed substance may be specified.
If the petitioner does not himself perform
all the manufacturing, processing, and packing operations for a food additive, the petition shall identify each person who will perform a part of such operations and designate
the part.
The petition shall include stability data,
and, if the data indicate that it is needed to
insure the identity, strength, quality, or purity of the additive, the expiration date that
will be employed.
B. The amount of the food additive proposed for use and the purposes for which it is
proposed, together with all directions, recommendations, and suggestions regarding
the proposed use, as well as specimens of the
labeling proposed for the food additive and
any labeling that will be required by applicable provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act on the finished food by reason
of the use of the food additive. If the additive
results or may reasonably be expected to result from the use of packaging material, the
petitioner shall show how this may occur
and what residues may reasonably be anticipated.
(Typewritten or other draft-labeling copy
will be accepted for consideration of the petition, provided a statement is made that
final printed labeling identical in content to
the draft copy will be submitted as soon as
available and prior to the marketing of the
food additive.)
(If the food additive is one for which a tolerance limitation is required to assure its
safety, the level of use proposed should be no
higher than the amount reasonably required
to accomplish the intended physical or other
technical effect, even though the safety data
may support a higher tolerance.)
C. Data establishing that the food additive
will have the intended physical or other
technical effect or that it may reasonably be
expected to become a component, or to affect
the characteristics, directly or indirectly, of
food and the amount necessary to accomplish this. These data should include information in sufficient detail to permit evaluation with control data.
D. A description of practicable methods to
determine the amount of the food additive in
the raw, processed, and/or finished food and
of any substance formed in or on such food
because of its use. The test proposed shall be
one that can be used for food-control purposes and that can be applied with consistent
results by any properly equipped and trained
laboratory personnel.
E. Full reports of investigations made with
respect to the safety of the food additive.
(A petition may be regarded as incomplete
unless it includes full reports of adequate
tests reasonably applicable to show whether

intended use. The reports ordinarily should
include detailed data derived from appropriate animal and other biological experiments in which the methods used and the results obtained are clearly set forth. The petition shall not omit without explanation any
reports of investigations that would bias an
evaluation of the safety of the food additive.)
F. Proposed tolerances for the food additive, if tolerances are required in order to insure its safety. A petitioner may include a
proposed regulation.
G. If submitting petition to modify an existing regulation issued pursuant to section
409(c)(1)(A) of the Act, full information on
each proposed change that is to be made in
the original regulation must be submitted.
The petition may omit statements made in
the original petition concerning which no
change is proposed. A supplemental petition
must be submitted for any change beyond
the variations provided for in the original
petition and the regulation issued on the
basis of the original petition.
H. The petitioner is required to submit either a claim for categorical exclusion under
§ 25.30 or 25.32 of this chapter or an environmental assessment under § 25.40 of this chapter.

(j) The Commissioner may request a
full description of the methods used in,
and the facilities and controls used for,
the production of the food additive, or
a sample of the food additive, articles
used as components thereof, or of the
food in which the additive is proposed
to be used, at any time while a petition
is under consideration. The Commissioner shall specify in the request for a
sample of the food additive, or articles
used as components thereof, or of the
food in or on which the additive is proposed to be used, a quantity deemed
adequate to permit tests of analytical
methods to determine quantities of the
food additive present in foods for which
it is intended to be used or adequate

(a) In some cases the Commissioner
will notify the petitioner that the petition, while technically complete, is inadequate to justify the establishment
of a regulation or the regulation requested by petitioner. This may be due
to the fact that the data are not sufficiently clear or complete. In such
cases, the petitioner may withdraw the
petition pending its clarification or the
obtaining of additional data. This withdrawal will be without prejudice to a
future filing. Upon refiling, the time
limitation will begin to run anew from

All glassware should be scrupulously
cleaned to remove all organic matter such as
oil, grease, detergent residues, etc. Examine
all glassware, including stoppers and stopcocks, under ultraviolet light to detect any
residual fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure, it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is
to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care
to avoid contamination of petroleum naphtha samples in handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising
from inadequate packaging is essential. Because some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons
sought in this test are very susceptible to
photo-oxidation, the entire procedure is to
be carried out under subdued light.

PROCEDURE

Determination of ultraviolet absorbance. Add
a 25-milliliter aliquot of the hydrocarbon
solvent together with 1 milliliter of hexadecane to the 125-milliliter Erlenmeyer
flask. While flushing with nitrogen, evaporate to 1 milliliter on a steam bath. Nitrogen
is admitted through a 8±1-milliliter outer-diameter tube, drawn out into a 2±1-centimeter
long and 1±0.5-millimeter inner-diameter
capillary tip. This is positioned so that the
capillary tip extends 4 centimeters into the
flask. The nitrogen flow rate is such that the

(c) The additive is used or intended
for use as a source of L-methionine to
improve significantly the biological
quality of the total protein in a food
containing naturally occurring primarily intact vegetable protein that is
considered a significant dietary protein
source, provided that:
(1) A reasonable daily adult intake of
the finished food furnishes at least 6.5
grams of naturally occurring primarily
intact vegetable protein.
(2) The additive results in a protein
efficiency ratio (PER) of protein in the
finished ready-to-eat food equivalent
to casein as determined by the method
specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
(3) The use of the additive results in
a statistically significant increase in
the PER as determined by the method
described in paragraph (d) of this section. The minimum amount of the additive to achieve the desired effect
must be used, and the increase in PER
over the primarily intact naturally occurring vegetable protein in the food
must be substantiated as a statistically significant difference with at
least a probability (P) value of less

to be tested. Add the blend slowly (approximately 1⁄2 minute) at the point of maximum
agitation to a stirred solution of 200 milliliters of distilled water previously heated to
80 °C in a 400-milliliter beaker. Continue mechanical stirring until the mixture is in solution, but stir for a minimum time of 30 minutes. Do not allow the water temperature to
drop below 60 °C.
Set the beaker and its contents aside to
cool in the absence of agitation. Allow a
minimum time of 2 hours for cooling. Examine the cooled beaker contents for a firm
rubbery gel formation after the temperature
drops below 40 °C.
In the event that a gel is obtained, make
up a 1 percent solution of the polysaccharide
to be tested in 200 milliliters of distilled
water previously heated to 80 °C (omit the locust bean gum). Allow the solution to cool
without agitation as before. Formation of a
gel on cooling indicates that the sample is a
gelling polysaccharide and not xanthan gum.
Record the sample as ‘‘positive’’ for xanthan gum if a firm, rubbery gel forms in the
presence of locust bean gum but not in its
absence. Record the sample as ‘‘negative’’ for
xanthan gum if no gel forms or if a soft or
brittle gel forms both with locust bean gum
and in a 1 percent solution of the sample
(containing no locust bean gum).

Compare the results with a curve of the optical density versus concentration of an authentic sample of pyruvic acid that has been
run through the procedure starting with the
preparation of the hydrazone.
Record the percent by weight of pyruvic
acid in the test polysaccharide. Note ‘‘positive’’ for xanthan gum if the sample contains
more than 1.5 percent of pyruvic acid and

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
All glassware should be scrupulously
cleaned to remove all organic matter such as
oil, grease, detergent residues, etc. Examine
all glassware, including stoppers and stopcocks, under ultraviolet light to detect any
residual fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure, it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is
to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care
to avoid contamination of hydrocarbon sol-

vent samples in handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising
from inadequate packaging is essential. Because some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons
sought in this test are very susceptible to
photo-oxidation, the entire procedure is to
be carried out under subdued light.
APPARATUS
Chromatographic tube. 450 millimeters in
length (packing section), inside diameter 19
millimeters ±1 millimeter, equipped with a
wad of clean Pyrex brand filtering wool (Corning Glass Works Catalog No. 3950 or equivalent). The tube shall contain a 250-milliliter
reservoir and a 2-millimeter tetrafluoroethylene polymer stopcock at the opposite
end. Overall length of the tube is 670 millimeters.
Stainless steel rod. 2 feet in length, 2 to 4
millimeters in diameter.
Vacuum oven. Similar to Labline No. 3610
but modified as follows: A copper tube onefourth inch in diameter and 13 inches in
length is bent to a right angle at the 4-inch
point and plugged at the opposite end; eight
copper tubes one-eighth inch in diameter and
5 inches in length are silver soldered in
drilled holes (one-eighth inch in diameter) to
the one-fourth-inch tube, one on each side at
the 5-, 7.5-, 10- and 12.5-inch points; the oneeighth-inch copper tubes are bent to conform
with the inner periphery of the oven.
Beakers. 250-milliliter and 500-milliliter capacity.
Graduated cylinders. 25-milliliter, 50-milliliter, and 150-milliliter capacity.
Tuberculin syringe. 1-milliliter capacity,
with 3-inch, 22-gauge needle.
Volumetric flask. 5-milliliter capacity.
Spectrophotometric
cells.
Fused
quartz
ground glass stoppered cells, optical path
length in the range of 1.000 centimeter ±0.005
centimeter. With distilled water in the cells,
determine any absorbance difference.
Spectrophotometer. Spectral range 250 millimicrons—400 millimicrons with spectral slit
width of 2 millimicrons or less: under instrument operating conditions for these absorbance measurements, the spectrophotometer
shall also meet the following performance
requirements:
Absorbance repeatability, ±0.01 at 0.4 absorbance.
Absorbance accuracy, 1 ±0.05 at 0.4 absorbance.
1 As determined by using potassium chromate for reference standard and described in

with isooctane and determine the absorbance
in a 1-centimeter cell compared to isooctane
as reference between 280 mμ-400mμ. The absorbance per centimeter path length shall
not exceed 0.00 in this range. If necessary, nhexadecane may be purified by percolation
through activated silica gel or by distillation.
Silica gel, 28–200 mesh (Grade 12, Davison
Chemical Co., Baltimore, Md., or equivalent).
Activate as follows: Weigh about 900 grams
into a 1-gallon bottle, add 100 milliliters of
de-ionized water, seal the bottle and shake
and roll at intervals for 1 hour. Allow to
equilibrate overnight in the sealed bottle.
Activate the gel at 150 °C for 16 hours, in a
2-inch × 7-inch × 12-inch porcelain pan loosely covered with aluminum foil, cool in a
dessicator, transfer to a bottle and seal.
PROCEDURE
Determination of ultraviolet absorbance. Before proceeding with the analysis of a sample
determine the absorbance in a 1-centimeter
path cell for the reagent blank by carrying
out the procedure without a sample. Record
the absorbance in the wavelength range of
280 to 400 millimicrons. Typical reagent
blank absorbance in this range should not
exceed 0.04 in the 280 to 299 millimicron
range, 0.02 in the 300 to 359 millimicron
range, and 0.01 in the 360 to 400 millimicron
range. If the characteristic benzene peaks in
the 250 to 260 millimicron region are present,
remove the benzene by the procedure described above under ‘‘Reagents and Materials,’’ ‘‘Organic Solvents,’’ and record absorbance again.
Transfer 50 grams of silica gel to the
chromatographic tube for sample analysis.
Raise and drop the column on a semisoft,
clean surface for about 1 minute to settle the
gel. Pour 100 milliliters of hexane into the
column with the stopcock open and allow to
drain to about one-half inch above the gel.
Turn off the stopcock and allow the column
to cool for 30 minutes. After cooling, vibrate
the column to eliminate air and stir the top
1 to 2 inches with a small diameter stainless
steel rod. Take care not to get the gel above
the liquid and onto the sides of the column.

Weigh out 40 grams ±0.1 gram of the hydrocarbon solvent sample into a 250-milliliter
beaker, add 50 milliliters of hexane, and pour
the solution into the column. Rinse the
beaker with 50 milliliters of hexane and add
this to the column. Allow the hexane sample
solution to elute into a 500-milliliter beaker
until the solution is about one-half inch
above the gel. Rinse the column three times
with 50-milliliter portions of hexane. Allow
each hexane rinse to separately elute to
about one-half inch above the gel. Replace
the eluate beaker (discard the hexane eluate)
with a 250-milliliter beaker. Add two separate 25-milliliter portions of 10 percent 1,2dichloroethane and allow each to separately
elute as before. Finally, add 150 milliliters of
10 percent 1,2-dichloroethane for a total of
200 milliliters. When the final 10 percent 1,2dichloroethane fraction is about one-half
inch above the top of the gel bed, replace the
receiving
beaker
(discard
the
1,2dichloroethane eluate) with a 250-milliliter
beaker containing 1 milliliter of hexadecane.
Adjust the elution rate to 2 to 3 milliliters
per minute, add two 25-milliliter portions of
40 percent benzene and allow each to separately elute as before to within about onehalf inch of the gel bed. Finally, add 150 milliliters of 40 percent benzene for a total of 200
milliliters. Evaporate the benzene in the
oven with vacuum and sufficient nitrogen
flow to just ripple the top of the benzene solution. When the benzene is removed (as determined by a constant volume of hexadecane) add 5 milliliters of isooctane and
evaporate. Repeat once to insure complete
removal of benzene. Remove the beaker and
cover with aluminum foil (previously rinsed
with hexane) until cool.
Quantitatively transfer the hexadecane
residue to a 5-milliliter volumetric flask and
dilute to volume with isooctane. Determine
the absorbance of the solution in 1-centimeter path length cells between 280 and 400
millimicrons using isooctane as a reference.
Correct the absorbance values for any absorbance derived from reagents as determined by carrying out the procedure without
a sample. If the corrected absorbance does
not exceed the limits prescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the sample
meets the ultraviolet absorbance specifications for hydrocarbon solvent.

(c) Synthetic fatty alcohols may be

ANALYTICAL SPECIFICATION FOR PETROLEUM
WAX
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

Because of the sensitivity of the test, the
possibility of errors arising from contamination is great. It is of the greatest importance
that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to
remove all organic matter such as oil,
grease, detergent residues, etc. Examine all
glassware, including stoppers and stopcocks,
under ultraviolet light to detect any residual
fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is
to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care
to avoid contamination of wax samples in
handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate
packaging is essential. Because some of the
polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test
are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the
entire procedure is to be carried out under
subdued light.

the flask will speed evaporation). Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. (To the residue from
benzene add a 10–milliliter portion of purified isooctane, reevaporate, and repeat once
to insure complete removal of benzene.)
Alternatively, the evaporation time can be
reduced by using the optional evaporation
flask. In this case the solvent and n-hexadecane are placed in the flask on the steam
bath, the tube assembly is inserted, and a
stream of nitrogen is fed through the inlet
tube while the outlet tube is connected to a
solvent trap and vacuum line in such a way
as to prevent any flow-back of condensate
into the flask.
Dissolve the 1 milliliter of hexadecane residue in isooctane and make to 25 milliliters
volume. Determine the absorbance in the 5–
centimeter path length cells compared to
isooctane as reference. The absorbance of the
solution of the solvent residue (except for
methyl alcohol) shall not exceed 0.01 per centimeter path length between 280 and 400 mμ.
For methyl alcohol this absorbance value
shall be 0.00.
Isooctane (2,2,4–trimethylpentane). Use 180
milliliters for the test described in the preceding paragraph. Purify, if necessary, by
passage through a column of activated silica
gel (Grade 12, Davison Chemical Company,
Baltimore, Maryland, or equivalent) about 90
centimeters in length and 5 centimeters to 8
centimeters in diameter.
Benzene, A.C.S. reagent grade. Use 150 milliliters for the test. Purify, if necessary, by
distillation or otherwise.
Acetone, A.C.S. reagent grade. Use 200 milliliters for the test. Purify, if necessary, by
distillation.
Eluting mixtures:
1. 10 percent benzene in isooctane. Pipet 50
milliliters of benzene into a 500–milliliter
glass-stoppered volumetric flask and adjust
to volume with isooctane, with mixing.
2. 20 percent benzene in isooctane. Pipet 50
milliliters of benzene into a 250–milliliter
glass-stoppered volumetric flask, and adjust
to volume with isooctane, with mixing.
3. Acetone-benzene-water mixture. Add 20
milliliters of water to 380 milliliters of acetone and 200 milliliters of benzene, and mix.
n-Hexadecane, 99 percent olefin-free. Dilute
1.0 milliliter of n-hexadecane to 25 milliliters
with isooctane and determine the absorbance
in a 5–centimeter cell compared to isooctane
as reference point between 280 mμ–400 mμ.
The absorbance per centimeter path length
shall not exceed 0.00 in this range. Purify, if
necessary, by percolation through activated
silica gel or by distillation.
Methyl alcohol, A.C.S. reagent grade. Use
10.0 milliliters of methyl alcohol. Purify, if
necessary, by distillation.
Dimethyl sulfoxide. Pure grade, clear,
water-white, m.p. 18° minimum. Dilute 120
milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide with 240

milliliters of distilled water in a 500–milliliter separatory funnel, mix and allow to
cool for 5–10 minutes. Add 40 milliliters of
isooctane to the solution and extract by
shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes.
Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second 500–milliliter separatory funnel and repeat the extraction with 40 milliliters of isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous
layer. Wash each of the 40–milliliter extractives three times with 50–milliliter portions
of distilled water. Shaking time for each
wash is 1 minute. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extractive through anhydrous sodium sulfate prewashed with isooctane (see Sodium sulfate under ‘‘Reagents
and Materials’’ for preparation of filter), into
a 250–milliliter Erlenmeyer flask, or optionally into the evaporating flask. Wash the
first separatory funnel with the second 40–
milliliter isooctane extractive, and pass
through the sodium sulfate into the flask.
Then wash the second and first separatory
funnels successively with a 10–milliliter portion of isooctane, and pass the solvent
through the sodium sulfate into the flask.
Add 1 milliliter of n-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under
nitrogen. Discontinue evaporation when not
over 1 milliliter of residue remains. To the
residue, add a 10–milliliter portion of isooctane and reevaporate to 1 milliliter of
hexadecane. Again, add 10 milliliters of isooctane to the residue and evaporate to 1 milliliter of hexadecane to insure complete removal of all volatile materials. Dissolve the
1 milliliter of hexadecane in isooctane and
make to 25–milliliter volume. Determine the
reference. The absorbance of the solution
should not exceed 0.02 per centimeter path
length in the 280 mμ–400 mμ range. (NOTE.
Difficulty in meeting this absorbance specification may be due to organic impurities in
the distilled water. Repetition of the test
omitting the dimethyl sulfoxide will disclose
their presence. If necessary to meet the specification, purify the water by redistillation,
passage through an ion-exchange resin, or
otherwise.)
Purify, if necessary, by the following procedure: To 1,500 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 2–liter glass-stoppered flask, add
6.0 milliliters of phosphoric acid and 50
grams of Norit A (decolorizing carbon, alkaline) or equivalent. Stopper the flask, and
with the use of a magnetic stirrer (tetrafluoroethylene polymer coated bar) stir the
solvent for 15 minutes. Filter the dimethyl
sulfoxide through four thicknesses of fluted
paper (18.5 centimeters, Schleicher &
Schuell, No. 597, or equivalent). If the initial
filtrate contains carbon fines, refilter
through the same filter until a clear filtrate
is obtained. Protect the sulfoxide from air
and moisture during this operation by covering the solvent in the funnel and collection
flask with a layer of isooctane. Transfer the

filtrate to a 2–liter separatory funnel and
draw off the dimethyl sulfoxide into the 2–
liter distillation flask of the vacuum distillation assembly and distill at approximately 3–millimeter Hg pressure or less. Discard the first 200–milliliter fraction of the
distillate and replace the distillate collection flask with a clean one. Continue the distillation until approximately 1 liter of the
sulfoxide has been collected.
At completion of the distillation, the reagent should be stored in glass-stoppered bottles since it is very hygroscopic and will
react with some metal containers in the
presence of air.
Phosphoric acid. 85 percent A.C.S. reagent
grade.
Sodium borohydride. 98 percent.
Magnesium oxide (Sea Sorb 43, Food Machinery Company, Westvaco Division, distributed by
chemical supply firms, or equivalent). Place 100
grams of the magnesium oxide in a large
beaker, add 700 milliliters of distilled water
to make a thin slurry, and heat on a steam
bath for 30 minutes with intermittent stirring. Stir well initially to insure that all the
absorbent is completely wetted. Using a
Buchner funnel and a filter paper (Schleicher
& Schuell No. 597, or equivalent) of suitable
diameter, filter with suction. Continue suction until water no longer drips from the
funnel. Transfer the absorbent to a glass
trough lined with aluminum foil (free from
rolling oil). Break up the magnesia with a
clean spatula and spread out the absorbent
on the aluminum foil in a layer about 1 centimeter to 2 centimeters thick. Dry for 24
hours at 160 °C ±1 °C. Pulverize the magnesia
with mortar and pestle. Sieve the pulverized
absorbent between 60–180 mesh. Use the magnesia retained on the 180–mesh sieve.
Celite 545. Johns-Manville Company, diatomaceous earth, or equivalent.
Magnesium oxide-Celite 545 mixture (2+ 1) by
weight. Place the magnesium oxide (60–180
mesh) and the Celite 545 in 2 to 1 proportions, respectively, by weight in a glassstoppered flask large enough for adequate
mixing. Shake vigorously for 10 minutes.
Transfer the mixture to a glass trough lined
with aluminum foil (free from rolling oil)
and spread it out on a layer about 1 centimeter to 2 centimeters thick. Reheat the
mixture at 160 °C ±1 °C for 2 hours, and store
in a tightly closed flask.
Sodium sulfate, anhydrous, A.C.S. reagent
grade, preferably in granular form. For each
bottle of sodium sulfate reagent used, establish as follows the necessary sodium sulfate
prewash to provide such filters required in
the method: Place approximately 35 grams of
anhydrous sodium sulfate in a 30–milliliter
coarse, fritted-glass funnel or in a 65–millimeter filter funnel with glass wool plug;
wash with successive 15–milliliter portions of
the indicated solvent until a 15–milliliter
portion of the wash shows 0.00 absorbance

per centimeter path length between 280 mμ
and 400 mμ when tested as prescribed under
‘‘Organic solvents.’’ Usually three portions
of wash solvent are sufficient.
Before proceeding with analysis of a sample, determine the absorbance in a 5–centimeter path cell between 250 mμ and 400 mμ
for the reagent blank by carrying out the
procedure, without a wax sample, at room
temperature, recording the spectra after the
extraction stage and after the complete procedure as prescribed. The absorbance per
centimeter path length following the extraction stage should not exceed 0.040 in the
wavelength range from 280 mμ to 400 mμ; the
absorbance per centimeter path length following the complete procedure should not
exceed 0.070 in the wavelength range from 280
mμ to 299 mμ, inclusive, nor 0.045 in the
wavelength range from 300 mμ to 400 mμ. If in
either spectrum the characteristic benzene
peaks in the 250 mμ–260 mμ region are
present, remove the benzene by the procedure under ‘‘Organic solvents’’ and record
absorbance again.
Place 300 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide
in a 1–liter separatory funnel and add 75 milliliters of phosphoric acid. Mix the contents
of the funnel and allow to stand for 10 minutes. (The reaction between the sulfoxide
and the acid is exothermic. Release pressure
after mixing, then keep funnel stoppered.)
Add 150 milliliters of isooctane and shake to
preequilibrate the solvents. Draw off the individual layers and store in glass-stoppered
flasks.
Place a representative 1–kilogram sample
of wax, or if this amount is not available, the
entire sample, in a beaker of a capacity
about three times the volume of the sample
and heat with occasional stirring on a steam
bath until the wax is completely melted and
homogeneous. Weigh four 25–gram ±0.2 gram
portions of the melted wax in separate 100–
milliliter beakers. Reserve three of the portions for later replicate analyses as necessary. Pour one weighed portion immediately after remelting (on the steam bath)
into a 500–milliliter separatory funnel containing 100 milliliters of the preequilibrated
sulfoxide-phosphoric acid mixture that has
been heated in the heating jacket at a temperature just high enough to keep the wax
melted. (NOTE: In preheating the sulfoxideacid mixture, remove the stopper of the separatory funnel at intervals to release the
pressure.)
Promptly complete the transfer of the
sample to the funnel in the jacket with portions of the preequilibrated isooctane, warming the beaker, if necessary, and using a
total volume of just 50 milliliters of the solvent. If the wax comes out of solution during
these operations, let the stoppered funnel remain in the jacket until the wax redissolves.

to release pressure.) When the wax is in solution, remove the funnel from the jacket and
shake it vigorously for 2 minutes. Set up
three 250–milliliter separatory funnels with
each
containing
30
milliliters
of
preequilibrated isooctane. After separation
of the liquid phases, allow to cool until the
main portion of the wax-isooctane solution
begins to show a precipitate. Gently swirl
the funnel when precipitation first occurs on
the inside surface of the funnel to accelerate
this process. Carefully draw off the lower
layer, filter it slowly through a thin layer of
glass wool fitted loosely in a filter funnel
into the first 250–milliliter separatory funnel, and wash in tandem with the 30–milliliter portions of isooctane contained in the
250–milliliter separatory funnels. Shaking
time for each wash is 1 minute. Repeat the
extraction operation with two additional
portions of the sulfoxide-acid mixture, replacing the funnel in the jacket after each
extraction to keep the wax in solution and
washing each extractive in tandem through
the same three portions of isooctane.
Collect the successive extractives (300 milliliters total) in a separatory funnel (preferably 2–liter), containing 480 milliliters of
distilled water, mix, and allow to cool for a
few minutes after the last extractive has
been added. Add 80 milliliters of isooctane to
the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Draw off the
lower aqueous layer into a second separatory
funnel (preferably 2–liter) and repeat the extraction with 80 milliliters of isooctane.
Draw off and discard the aqueous layer.
Wash each of the 80–milliliter extractives
three times with 100–milliliter portions of
distilled water. Shaking time for each wash
is 1 minute. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extractive through anhydrous
sodium sulfate prewashed with isooctane (see
Sodium Sulfate under ‘‘Reagents and Materials’’ for preparation of filter) into a 250–
milliliter Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally
into the evaporation flask). Wash the first
separatory funnel with the second 80–milliliter isooctane extractive and pass through
the sodium sulfate. Then wash the second
and first separatory funnels successively
with a 20–milliliter portion of isooctane and
pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate
into the flask. Add 1 milliliter of n-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane on the
steam bath under nitrogen. Discontinue
evaporation when not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10–milliliter portion of isooctane, reevaporate to 1
milliliter of hexadecane, and repeat this operation once.
Quantitatively transfer the residue with
isooctane to a 25–milliliter volumetric flask,
make to volume, and mix. Determine the absorbance of the solution in the 5–centimeter
path length cells compared to isooctane as
reference between 280 mμ–400 mμ (take care

to lose none of the solution in filling the
sample cell). Correct the absorbance values
for any absorbance derived from reagents as
determined by carrying out the procedure
without a wax sample. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits prescribed in this paragraph (b), the wax meets
the ultraviolet absorbance specifications. If
the corrected absorbance per centimeter
path length exceeds the limits prescribed in
this paragraph (b), proceed as follows:
Quantitatively transfer the isooctane solution to a 125–milliliter flask equipped with
24/40 joint and evaporate the isooctane on
the steam bath under a stream of nitrogen to
a volume of 1 milliliter of hexadecane. Add
10 milliliters of methyl alcohol and approximately 0.3 gram of sodium borohydride.
(Minimize exposure of the borohydride to the
atmosphere. A measuring dipper may be
used.) Immediately fit a water-cooled condenser equipped with a 24/40 joint and with a
drying tube into the flask, mix until the
borohydride is dissolved, and allow to stand
for 30 minutes at room temperature, with
intermittent swirling. At the end of this period, disconnect the flask and evaporate the
methyl alcohol on the steam bath under nitrogen until the sodium borohydride begins
to come out of the solution. Then add 10 milliliters of isooctane and evaporate to a volume of about 2–3 milliliters. Again, add 10
milliliters of isooctane and concentrate to a
volume of approximately 5 milliliters. Swirl
the flask repeatedly to assure adequate
washing of the sodium borohydride residues.
Fit the tetrafluoroethylene polymer disc
on the upper part of the stem of the
chromatographic tube, then place the tube
with the disc on the suction flask and apply
the vacuum (approximately 135 millimeters
Hg pressure). Weight out 14 grams of the 2:1
magnesium oxide-Celite 545 mixture and
pour the adsorbent mixture into the
chromatographic tube in approximately 3–
centimeter layers. After the addition of each
layer, level off the top of the adsorbent with
a flat glass rod or metal plunger by pressing
down firmly until the adsorbent is well
packed. Loosen the topmost few millimeters
of each adsorbent layer with the end of a
metal rod before the addition of the next
layer. Continue packing in this manner until
all the 14 grams of the adsorbent is added to
the tube. Level off the top of the adsorbent
by pressing down firmly with a flat glass rod
or metal plunger to make the depth of the
adsorbent bed approximately 12.5 centimeters in depth. Turn off the vacuum and remove the suction flask. Fit the 500–milliliter
reservoir
onto
the
top
of
the
chromatographic column and prewet the column by passing 100 milliliters of isooctane
through the column. Adjust the nitrogen
pressure so that the rate of descent of the
isooctane coming off of the column is between 2–3 milliliters per minute. Discontinue

pressure just before the last of the isooctane
reaches the level of the adsorbent. (CAUTION:
Do not allow the liquid level to recede below
the adsorbent level at any time.) Remove the
reservoir and decant the 5–milliliter isooctane concentrate solution onto the column
and with slight pressure again allow the liquid level to recede to barely above the adsorbent level. Rapidly complete the transfer
similarly with two 5–milliliter portions of
isooctane, swirling the flask repeatedly each
time to assure adequate washing of the residue. Just before the final 5–milliliter wash
reaches the top of the adsorbent, add 100 milliliters of isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at the 2–3 milliliter per
minute rate. Just before the last of the isooctane reaches the adsorbent level, add 100
milliliters of 10 percent benzene in isooctane
to the reservoir and continue the percolation
at the aforementioned rate. Just before the
solvent mixture reaches adsorbent level, add
25 milliliters of 20 percent benzene in isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at 2–3 milliliters per minute until
all this solvent mixture has been removed
from the column. Discard all the elution solvents collected up to this point. Add 300 milliliters of the acetone-benzene-water mixture
to the reservoir and percolate through the
column to elute the polynuclear compounds.
Collect the eluate in a clean 1–liter separatory funnel. Allow the column to drain
until most of the solvent mixture is removed. Wash the eluate three times with
300–milliliter portions of distilled water,
shaking well for each wash. (The addition of
small amounts of sodium chloride facilitates
separation.) Discard the aqueous layer after
each wash. After the final separation, filter
the residual benzene through anhydrous sodium sulfate prewashed with benzene (see Sodium sulfate under ‘‘Reagents and Materials’’
for preparation of filter) into a 250–milliliter
Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into the
evaporation flask). Wash the separatory funnel with two additional 20–milliliter portions
of benzene which are also filtered through
the sodium sulfate. Add 1 milliliter of nhexadecane and completely remove the benzene by evaporation under nitrogen, using
the special procedure to eliminate benzene
as previously described under ‘‘Organic Solvents.’’ Quantitatively transfer the residue
with isooctane to a 25–milliliter volumetric
flask and adjust to volume. Determine the
absorbance of the solution in the 5–centimeter path length cells compared to isooctane as reference between 250 mμ–400 mμ.
Correct for any absorbance derived from the
reagents as determined by carrying out the
procedure without a wax sample. If either
spectrum shows the characteristic benzene
peaks in the 250 mμ–260 mμ region, evaporate
the solution to remove benzene by the procedure under ‘‘Organic Solvents.’’ Dissolve the
residue, transfer quantitatively, and adjust

to volume in isooctane in a 25–milliliter volumetric flask. Record the absorbance again.
If the corrected absorbance does not exceed
the limits prescribed in this paragraph (b),
the wax meets the ultraviolet absorbance
specifications.

§ 173.25

(5) The ion-exchange resin identified
in paragraph (a)(20) of this section is
limited to use in aqueous process
streams for the isolation and purification of protein concentrates and isolates under the following conditions:
(i) For resins that comply with the
requirements in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of
this section, the pH range for the resin
shall be no less than 3.5 and no more
than 9, and the temperatures of water
and food passing through the resin bed
shall not exceed 25 °C.
(ii) For resins that comply with the
requirements in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of
this section, the pH range for the resin
shall be no less than 2 and no more
than 10, and the temperatures of water
and food passing through the resin
shall not exceed 50 °C.
(c) To insure safe use of ion-exchange
resins, each ion-exchange resin will be:
(1) Subjected to pre-use treatment by
the manufacturer and/or the user in accordance with the manufacturer’s directions prescribed on the label or labeling accompanying the resins, to
guarantee a food-grade purity of ionexchange resins, in accordance with
good manufacturing practice.
(2) Accompanied by label or labeling
to include directions for use consistent
with the intended functional purpose of
the resin.
(3) Used in compliance with the label
or labeling required by paragraph (c)(2)
of this section.
(4) Found to result in no more than 1
part per million of organic extractives
obtained with each of the named solvents, distilled water, 15 percent alcohol, and 5 percent acetic acid when,
having been washed and otherwise
treated in accordance with the manufacturer’s directions for preparing
them for use with food, the ion-exchange resin is subjected to the following test: Using a separate ion-exchange column for each solvent, prepare columns using 50 milliliters of the
ready to use ion-exchange resin that is
to be tested. While maintaining the
highest temperature that will be encountered in use pass through these
beds at the rate of 350–450 milliliters
per hour the three test solvents distilled water, 15 percent (by volume)
ethyl alcohol, and 5 percent (by weight)
acetic acid. The first liter of effluent

from each solvent is discarded, then
the next 2 liters are used to determine
organic extractives. The 2-liter sample
is carefully evaporated to constant
weight at 105 °C; this is total extractives. This residue is fired in a muffle
furnace at 850 °C to constant weight;
this is ash. Total extractives, minus
ash equals the organic extractives. If
the organic extractives are greater
than 1 part per million of the solvent
used, a blank should be run on the solvent and a correction should be made
by subtracting the total extractives obtained with the blank from the total
extractives obtained in the resin test.
The solvents used are to be made as
follows:
Distilled water (de-ionized water is distilled).
15 percent ethyl alcohol made by mixing 15
volumes of absolute ethyl alcohol A.C.S.
reagent grade, with 85 volumes of distilled
de-ionized water.
5 percent acetic acid made by mixing 5 parts
by weight of A.C.S. reagent grade glacial
acetic acid with 95 parts by weight of distilled de-ionized water.

In addition to the organic extractives
limitation prescribed in this paragraph, the ion-exchange resin identified in paragraph (a)(17) of this section,
when extracted with each of the named
solvents, distilled water, 50 percent alcohol, and 5 percent acetic acid, will be
found to result in not more than 7
parts per million of nitrogen extractives (calculated as nitrogen) when the
resin in the free-base form is subjected
to the following test immediately before each use: Using a separate 1–inch
diameter glass ion-exchange column
for each solvent, prepare each column
using 100 milliliters of ready to use ionexchange resin that is to be tested.
With the bottom outlet closed, fill each
ion-exchange column with one of the
three solvents at a temperature of 25 °C
until the solvent level is even with the
top of the resin bed. Seal each column
at the top and bottom and store in a
vertical position at a temperature of 25
°C. After 96 hours, open the top of each
column, drain the solvent into a collection vessel, and analyze each drained
solvent and a solvent blank for nitrogen by a standard micro-Kjeldahl
method.
(d)(1) The ion-exchange resins identified in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(11),

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

Because of the sensitivity of the test, the
possibility of errors arising from contamination is great. It is of the greatest importance
that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to
remove all organic matter such as oil,
grease, detergent residues, etc. Examine all
glassware including stoppers and stopcocks,
under ultraviolet light to detect any residual
fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is
to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care
to avoid contamination of citric acid samples in handling is essential to assure absence of any extraneous material arising
from inadequate packaging. Because some of
the polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this
test are very susceptible to photo-oxidation,
the entire procedure is to be carried out
under subdued light.

Silica gel, 28–200 mesh (Grade 12, Davison
Chemical Co., Baltimore, MD, or equivalent).
Activate as follows: Slurry 900 grams of silica gel reagent with 2 liters of purified water
in a 3-liter beaker. Cool the mixture and
pour into a 80 × 900 chromatographic column
with coarse fritted disc. Drain the water,

wash with an additional 6 liters of purified
water and wash with 3,600 milliliters of purified methyl alcohol at a relatively slow rate.
Drain all of the solvents and transfer the
silica gel to an aluminum foil-lined drying
dish. Place foil over the top of the dish. Activate in a vacuum oven at low vacuum (approximately 750 millimeters Mercury or 27
inches of Mercury below atmospheric pressure) at 173° to 177 °C for at least 20 hours.
Cool under vacuum and store in an amber
bottle.
Sodium sulfate, anhydrous, A.C.S. reagent
grade. This reagent should be washed with
purified isooctane. Check the purity of this
reagent as described in § 172.886 of this chapter.
Water, purified. All water used must meet
the specifications of the following test:
Extract 600 milliliters of water with 50 milliliters of purified isooctane. Add 1 milliliter
of purified n-hexadecane to the isooctane extract and evaporate the resulting solution to
1 milliliter. The absorbance of this residue
shall not exceed 0.02 per centimeter path
length between 300–400 nanometers and 0.03
per centimeter path length between 280–299
nanometers. If necessary, water may be purified by distillation, extraction with purified
organic solvents, treatment with an absorbent (e.g., activated carbon) followed by filtration of the absorbent or otherwise.
PROCEDURE

Separate portions of 200 milliliters of purified water are taken through the procedure
for use as control blanks. Each citric acid
sample is processed as follows: Weigh 200
grams of anhydrous citric acid into a 500 milliliter flask and dissolve in 200 milliliters of
pure water. Heat the solution to 60 °C and
transfer to a 500 milliliter separatory funnel.
Rinse the flask with 50 milliliters of isooctane and add the isooctane to the separatory funnel. Gently shake the mixture 90
times (caution: vigorous shaking will cause
emulsions) with periodic release of the pressure caused by shaking.
Allow the phases to separate for at least 5
minutes. Draw off the lower aqueous layer
into a second 500-milliliter separatory funnel
and repeat the extraction with a second aliquot of 50 milliliters of isooctane. After separation of the layers, draw off and discard
the water layer. Combine both isooctane extracts in the funnel containing the first extract. Rinse the funnel which contained the
second extract with 10 milliliters of isooctane and add this portion to the combined
isooctane extract.
A chromatographic column containing 5.5
grams of silica gel and 3 grams of anhydrous
sodium sulfate is prepared for each citric
acid sample as follows: Fit 18 × 300 column
with a small glass wool plug. Rinse the inside of the column with 10 milliliters of purified isooctane. Drain the isooctane from the

column. Pour 5.5 grams of activated silica
gel into the column. Tap the column approximately 20 times on a semisoft, clean
surface to settle the silica gel. Carefully
pour 3 grams of anhydrous sodium sulfate
onto the top of the silica gel in the column.
Carefully drain the isooctane extract of
the citric acid solution into the column in a
series of additions while the isooctane is
draining from the column at an elution rate
of approximately 3 milliliters per minute.
Rinse the separatory funnel with 10 milliliters of isooctane after the last portion of
the extract has been applied to the column
and add this rinse to the column. After all of
the extract has been applied to the column
and the solvent layer reaches the top of the
sulfate bed, rinse the column with 25 milliliters of isooctane followed by 10 milliliters
of a 10-percent dichloroethane in hexane solution. For each rinse solution, drain the column until the solvent layer reaches the top
of the sodium sulfate bed. Discard the rinse
solvents. Place a 250-milliliter round bottom
flask containing 0.5 milliliter of purified nhexadecane under the column. Elute the
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons from the
column with 30 milliliters of 40-percent benzene in hexane solution. Drain the eluate
until the 40-percent benzene in the hexane
solvent reaches the top of the sodium sulfate
bed.
Evaporate the 40-percent benzene in
hexane eluate on the rotary vacuum evaporator at 45 °C until only the n-hexadecane
residue of 0.5 milliliter remains. Treat the nhexadecane residue twice with the following
wash step: Add 6 milliliters of purified isooctane and remove the solvents by vacuum
evaporation at 45 °C to constant volume, i.e.,
0.5 milliliter. Cool the n-hexadecane residue
and transfer the solution to an 0.5-milliliter
microcuvette. Determine the absorbance of
this solution compared to purified n-hexadecane as reference. Correct the absorbance
values for any absorbance derived from the
control reagent blank. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits prescribed, the samples meet the ultraviolet absorbance specifications.
The reagent blank is prepared by using 200
milliliters of purified water in place of the
citric acid solution and carrying the water
sample through the procedure. The typical
control reagent blank should not exceed 0.03
absorbance per centimeter path length between 280 and 299 nanometers, 0.02 absorbance per centimeter path length between 300
and 359 nanometers, and 0.01 absorbance per
centimeter path length between 360 and 400
nanometers.

§ 173.350 Combustion product gas.
The food additive combustion product gas may be safely used in the processing and packaging of the foods designated in paragraph (c) of this section
for the purpose of removing and displacing oxygen in accordance with the
following prescribed conditions:
(a) The food additive is manufactured
by the controlled combustion in air of
butane, propane, or natural gas. The
combustion equipment shall be provided with an absorption-type filter capable of removing possible toxic impurities, through which all gas used in
the treatment of food shall pass; and
with suitable controls to insure that
any combustion products failing to
meet the specifications provided in this
section will be prevented from reaching
the food being treated.
(b) The food additive meets the following specifications:
(1) Carbon monoxide content not to
exceed 4.5 percent by volume.
(2) The ultraviolet absorbance in isooctane solution in the range 255 millimicrons to 310 millimicrons not to exceed one-third of the standard reference absorbance when tested as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
(c) It is used or intended for use to
displace or remove oxygen in the processing, storage, or packaging of beverage products and other food, except
fresh meats.
(d) To assure safe use of the additive
in addition to the other information required by the act, the label or labeling
of the combustion device shall bear
adequate directions for use to provide a
combustion product gas that complies
with the limitations prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, including instructions to assure proper filtration.
(e) The food additive is tested for
compliance with paragraph (b)(2) by
the following empirical method:
Spectrophotometric measurements. All measurements are made in an ultraviolet spectrophotometer in optical cells of 5 centimeters
in length, and in the range of 255 milli-

microns to 310 millimicrons, under the same
instrumental conditions. The standard reference absorbance is the absorbance at 275
millimicrons of a standard reference solution
of naphthalene (National Bureau of Standards Material No. 577 or equivalent in purity)
containing a concentration of 1.4 milligrams
per liter in purified isooctane, measured
against isooctane of the same spectral purity
in 5-centimeter cells. (This absorbance will
be approximately 0.30.)
Solvent. The solvent used is pure grade isooctane having an ultraviolet absorbance not
to exceed 0.05 measured against distilled
water as a reference. Upon passage of purified inert gas through some isooctane under
the identical conditions of the test, a lowering of the absorbance value has been observed. The absorbance of isooctane to be
used in this procedure shall not be more than
0.02 lower in the range 255 millimicrons to
310 millimicrons, inclusive, than that of the
untreated solvent as measured in a 5-centimeter cell. If necessary to obtain the prescribed purities, the isooctane may be passed
through activated silica gel.
Apparatus. To assure reproducible results,
the additive is passed into the isooctane solution through a gas-absorption train consisting of the following components and necessary connections:
1. A gas flow meter with a range up to 30
liters per hour provided with a constant differential relay or other device to maintain a
constant flow rate independent of the input
pressure.
2. An absorption apparatus consisting of an
inlet gas dispersion tube inserted to the bottom of a covered cylindrical vessel with a
suitable outlet on the vessel for effluent gas.
The dimensions and arrangement of tube and
vessel are such that the inlet tube introduces
the gas at a point not above 51⁄4 inches below
the surface of the solvent through a sintered
glass outlet. The dimensions of the vessel are
such, and both inlet and vessel are so designed, that the gas can be bubbled through
60 milliliters of isooctane solvent at a rate
up to 30 liters per hour without mechanical
loss of solvent. The level corresponding to 60
milliliters should be marked on the vessel.
3. A cooling bath containing crushed ice
and water to permit immersion of the absorption vessel at least to the solvent level
mark.
Caution. The various parts of the absorption train must be connected by gas-tight
tubing and joints composed of materials
which will neither remove components from
nor add components to the gas stream. The
gas source is connected in series to the flowrate device, the flow meter, and the absorption apparatus in that order. Ventilation
should be provided for the effluent gases
which may contain carbon monoxide.
Sampling procedure. Immerse the gas-absorption apparatus containing 60 milliliters

§ 174.5 General provisions applicable
to indirect food additives.
(a) Regulations prescribing conditions under which food additive substances may be safely used predicate
usage under conditions of good manufacturing practice. For the purpose of
this part and parts 175, 176, and 177 of
this chapter, good manufacturing practice shall be defined to include the following restrictions:
(1) The quantity of any food additive
substance that may be added to food as
a result of use in articles that contact
food shall not exceed, where no limits
are specified, that which results from
use of the substance in an amount not
more than reasonably required to accomplish the intended physical or technical effect in the food-contact article;
shall not exceed any prescribed limitations; and shall not be intended to accomplish any physical or technical effect in the food itself, except as such
may be permitted by regulations in
parts 170 through 189 of this chapter.

(2) Any substance used as a component of articles that contact food shall
be of a purity suitable for its intended
use.
(b) The existence in the subchapter B
of a regulation prescribing safe conditions for the use of a substance as an
article or component of articles that
contact food shall not be construed to
relieve such use of the substance or article from compliance with any other
provision of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act. For example, if a
regulated
food-packaging
material
were found on appropriate test to impart odor or taste to a specific food
product such as to render it unfit within the meaning of section 402(a)(3) of
the Act, the regulation would not be
construed to relieve such use from
compliance with section 402(a)(3).
(c) The existence in this subchapter B
of a regulation prescribing safe conditions for the use of a substance as an
article or component of articles that
contact food shall not be construed as
implying that such substance may be
safely used as a direct additive in food.
(d) Substances that under conditions
of good manufacturing practice may be
safely used as components of articles
that contact food include the following, subject to any prescribed limitations:
(1) Substances generally recognized
as safe in or on food.
(2) Substances generally recognized
as safe for their intended use in food
packaging.
(3) Substances used in accordance
with a prior sanction or approval.
(4) Substances permitted for use by
regulations in this part and parts 175,
176, 177, 178 and § 179.45 of this chapter.
(5) Food contact substances used in
accordance with an effective premarket notification for a food contact
substance (FCN) submitted under section 409(h) of the act.

(e) Analytical methods—(1) Selection of
extractability conditions. First ascertain
the type of food product (table 1, paragraph (d) of this section) that is being
packed commercially in the test container and the normal conditions of
thermal treatment used in packaging
the type of food involved. Using table 2
(paragraph (d) of this section), select
the food-simulating solvent or solvents
(demineralized
distilled
water,
heptane, and/or 8 percent ethyl alcohol)
and the time-temperature exaggerations of the container-use conditions.
Aqueous products (Types I, II, IV-B,
and VI-B) require only a waterextractability test at the temperature
and time conditions shown for the
most severe ‘‘conditions of use.’’ Aqueous products with free oil or fat, and
water-oil emulsions (types III, IV-A,
and VII) will require determinations of
both water extractability and heptane
extractability. Low-moisture fats and
oils (type V with no free water) require
only the heptane extractability. Alcoholic beverages (type VI-A) require
only the 8 percent alcohol extractant.
Having selected the appropriate extractant or extractants simulating various types of foods and beverages and
the time-temperature exaggerations
over normal use, follow the applicable
extraction procedure. Adapt the procedure, when necessary, for containers
having a capacity of over 1 gallon.
(2) Selection of coated-container samples. For consumer-sized containers up
to 1 gallon, quadruplicate samples of
representative containers (using for
each replicate sample the number of
containers nearest to an area of 180
square inches) should be selected from
the lot to be examined.
(3) Cleaning procedure preliminary to
determining the amount of extractables
from coated containers. Quadruplicate
samples of representative containers
should be selected from the lot to be
examined and must be carefully rinsed
to remove extraneous material prior to
the actual extraction procedure. Soda
fountain pressure-type hot water rinsing equipment, consisting in its simplest form of a 1⁄8-inch–1⁄4-inch internal
diameter metal tube attached to a hot
water line and bent so as to direct a
stream of water upward, may be used.
Be sure hot water has reached a tem-

perature of 190 °F–200 °F before starting
to rinse the container. Invert the container over the top of the fountain and
direct a strong stream of hot water
against the bottom and all sides for 1
minute, drain, and allow to dry.
(4) Exposure conditions—(i) Water (250
°F for 2 hours), simulating high-temperature heat sterilization. Fill the container
within 1⁄4-inch of the top with a measured volume of demineralized distilled
water. Cover the container with clean
aluminum foil and place the container
on a rack in a pressure cooker. Add a
small amount of demineralized distilled water to the pressure cooker, but
do not allow the water to touch the
bottom of the container. Close the
cooker securely and start to heat over
a suitable burner. When a steady
stream of steam emerges from the
vent, close the vent and allow the pressure to rise to 15 pounds per square
inch (250 °F) and continue to maintain
this pressure for 2 hours. Slowly release the pressure, open the pressure
cooker when the pressure reads zero,
and composite the water of each replicate immediately in a clean Pyrex
flask or beaker. Proceed with the determination of the amount of extractives by the method described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
(ii) Water (212 °F for 30 minutes), simulating boiling water sterilization. Fill the
container within 1⁄4-inch of the top
with a measured volume of boiling,
demineralized distilled water. Cover
the container with clean aluminum foil
and place the container on a rack in a
pressure cooker in which a small
amount of demineralized distilled
water is boiling. Do not close the pressure vent, but operate at atmospheric
pressure so that there is a continuous
escape of a small amount of steam.
Continue to heat for 30 minutes, then
remove the test container and composite the contents of each replicate
immediately in a clean Pyrex flask or
beaker. Proceed with the determination of the amount of extractives by
the method described in paragraph
(e)(5) of this section.
(iii) Water (from boiling to 100 °F), simulating hot fill or pasteurization above 150
°F. Fill the container within 1⁄4-inch of
the top with a measured volume of
boiling, demineralized distilled water.

this section for the particular container size, proceed to paragraph
(e)(5)(ii) of this section (method for determining the amount of chloroformsoluble extractives residue).
(ii) Chloroform-soluble extractives residue. Add 50 milliliters of chloroform
(freshly distilled reagent grade or a
grade having an established consistently low blank) to the dried and
weighed residue, (e), in the platinum
dish, obtained in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of
this section. Warm carefully, and filter
through Whatman No. 41 filter paper in
a Pyrex funnel, collecting the filtrate
in a clean, tared platinum dish. Repeat
the chloroform extraction, washing the
filter paper with this second portion of
chloroform. Add this filtrate to the
original filtrate and evaporate the
total down to a few milliliters on a
low-temperature hotplate. The last few
milliliters should be evaporated in an
oven maintained at 212 °F. Cool the
platinum dish in a desiccator for 30
minutes and weigh to the nearest 0.1
milligram to get the chloroform-soluble extractives residue (e′). This e′ is
substituted for e in the equations in
paragraph (e)(5)(i) (a) and (b) of this
section. If the concentration of extractives (Ex) still exceeds 50 parts per million or the extractives in milligrams
per square inch exceed the limitations
prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section for the particular container size,
proceed as follows to correct for zinc
extractives (‘‘C’’ enamels only): Ash
the residue in the platinum dish by

heating gently over a Meeker-type
burner to destroy organic matter and
hold at red heat for about 1 minute.
Cool in the air for 3 minutes, and place
the platinum dish in the desiccator for
30 minutes and weigh to the nearest 0.1
milligram. Analyze this ash for zinc by
standard Association of Official Agricultural Chemists methods or equivalent. Calculate the zinc in the ash as
zinc oleate, and subtract from the
weight of chloroform-soluble extractives residue (e′) to obtain the zinc-corrected chloroform-soluble extractives
residue (ee′). This ee′ is substituted for
e in the formulas in paragraph (e)(5)(i)
(a) and (b) of this section. To comply
with the limitations in paragraph (c) of
this section, the chloroform-soluble extractives residue (but after correction
for the zinc extractives in case of ‘‘C’’
enamels) must not exceed 50 parts per
million and must not exceed in milligrams per square inch the limitations
for the particular article as prescribed
in paragraph (c) of this section.
(f) Equipment and reagent requirements—(1) Equipment.
Rinsing equipment, soda fountain pressuretype hot water, consisting in simplest form

1 Heptane extractability results must be divided by a factor of five in arriving at the extractability for a food product having
water-in-oil emulsion or free oil or fat. Heptane food-simulating solvent is not required in the case of wax-polymer blend coatings
for corrugated paperboard containers intended for use in bulk packaging of iced meat, iced fish, and iced poultry.

(d) Analytical methods—(1) Selection of
extractability conditions. First ascertain
the type of food product (table 1, paragraph (c) of this section) that is being
packed commercially in the paper or
paperboard and the normal conditions
of thermal treatment used in packaging the type of food involved. Using
table 2, paragraph (c) of this section,
select the food-simulating solvent or
solvents and the time-temperature exaggerations of the paper or paperboard
use conditions. Having selected the appropriate food-simulating solvent or
solvents and the time-temperature ex-

aggeration over normal use, follow the
applicable extraction procedure.
(2) Reagents—(i) Water. All water used
in extraction procedures should be
freshly demineralized (deionized) distilled water.
(ii) n-Heptane. Reagent grade, freshly
redistilled before use, using only material boiling at 208 °F.
(iii) Alcohol. 8 or 50 percent (by volume), prepared from undenatured 95
percent ethyl alcohol diluted with
demineralized
(deionized)
distilled
water.
(iv) Chloroform. Reagent grade, freshly redistilled before use, or a grade

(3) Selection of test method. Paper or
paperboard ready for use in packaging
shall be tested by use of the extraction
cell described in ‘‘Official Methods of
Analysis of the Association of Official
Analytical Chemists,’’ 13th Ed. (1980),
sections 21.010–21.015, under ‘‘Exposing
Flexible Barrier Materials for Extraction,’’ which is incorporated by reference (Copies may be obtained from

paper and paperboard products may be
tested in the container by adapting the
in-container methods described in
§ 175.300(e) of this chapter. Formed
paper and paperboard products such as
containers and lids, that cannot be
tested satisfactorily by any of the
above methods may be tested in specially designed extraction equipment,
usually consisting of clamping devices
that fit the closure or container so
that the food-contact surface can be
tested, or, if flat samples can be cut
from the formed paper or paperboard
products without destroying the integrity of the food-contact surface, they
may be tested by adapting the following ‘‘sandwich’’ method:
(i) Apparatus. (a) Thermostated (±1.0
°F) water bath, variable between 70 °F
and 120 °F water bath cover capable of

holding at least one 800-milliliter beaker partially submersed in bath.
(b) Analytical balance sensitive to 0.1
milligram with an approximate capacity of 100 grams.
(c) Tongs.
(d) Hood and hot-plate facilities.
(e) Forced draft oven.
For each extraction, the following additional apparatus is necessary:
(f) One No. 2 paper clip.
(g) One 800-milliliter beaker with
watch-glass cover.
(h) One 250-milliliter beaker.
(i) Five 21⁄2-inch-square aluminum
screens (standard aluminum window
screening is acceptable).
(j) One wire capable of supporting
sample stack.
(ii) Procedure. (a) For each extraction, accurately cut eight 21⁄2-inchsquare samples from the formed paper
or paperboard product to be tested.
(b) Carefully stack the eight 21⁄2-inchsquare samples and the five 21⁄2-inchsquare aluminum screens in sandwich
form such that the food-contact side of
each sample is always next to an aluminum screen, as follows: Screen, sample, sample, screen, sample, sample,
screen, etc. Clip the sandwich together
carefully with a No. 2 paper clip, leaving just enough space at the top to slip
a wire through.
(c) Place an 800-milliliter beaker containing 100-milliliters of the appropriate food-simulating solvent into the
constant temperature bath, cover with
a watch glass and condition at the desired temperature.
(d) After conditioning, carefully
lower the sample sandwich with tongs
into the beaker.
(e) At the end of the extraction period, using the tongs, carefully lift out
the sample sandwich and hang it over
the beaker with the wire.
(f) After draining, pour the food-simulating solvent solution into a tared
250-milliliter beaker. Rinse the 800-milliliter beaker three times, using a total
of not more than 50 milliliters of the
required solvent.
(g) Determine total nonvolatile extractives in accordance with paragraph
(d)(5) of this section.
(4) Selection of samples. Quadruplicate
samples should be tested, using for
each replicate sample the number of

cups, containers, or preformed or converted products nearest to an area of
100 square inches.
(5) Determination of amount of extractives—(i) Total residues. At the end of
the exposure period, remove the test
container or test cell from the oven
and combine the solvent for each replicate in a clean Pyrex (or equivalent)
flask or beaker being sure to rinse the
test container or cell with a small
quantity of clean solvent. Evaporate
the food-simulating solvents to about
100 milliliters in the flask or beaker,
and transfer to a clean, tared
evaporating dish (platinum or Pyrex),
washing the flask three times with
small portions of solvent used in the
extraction procedure, and evaporate to
a few milliliters on a nonsparking, lowtemperature hotplate. The last few
milliliters should be evaporated in an
oven maintained at a temperature of
approximately
221
°F.
Cool
the
evaporating dish in a desiccator for 30
minutes and weigh the residue to the
nearest 0.1 milligram, (e). Calculate the
extractives in milligrams per square
inch of the container or sheeted paper
or paperboard surface.
(a) Water and 8- and 50-percent alcohol.
Milligrams extractives per square

where:
e=Milligrams extractives per sample tested.
s=Surface area tested, in square inches.
F=Five, the ratio of the amount of extractives removed by heptane under exaggerated time-temperature test conditions
compared to the amount extracted by a fat
or oil under exaggerated conditions of
thermal sterilization and use.
e′=Chloroform-soluble extractives residue.
ee′=Corrected chloroform-soluble extractives
residue.
e′ or ee′ is substituted for e in the above equations when necessary.

If when calculated by the equations in
paragraph (d)(5)(i) (a) and (b) of this
section, the extractives in milligrams
per square inch exceeds the limitations
prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, proceed to paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of
this section (method for determining
the amount of chloroform-soluble extractives residues).
(ii) Chloroform-soluble extractives residue. Add 50 milliliters of chloroform

(freshly distilled reagent grade or a
grade having an established consistently low blank) to the dried and
weighed residue, (e), in the evaporating
dish obtained in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of
this section. Warm carefully, and filter
through Whatman No. 41 filter paper
(or equivalent) in a Pyrex (or equivalent) funnel, collecting the filtrate in a
clean, tared evaporating dish (platinum
or Pyrex). Repeat the chloroform extraction, washing the filter paper with
this second portion of chloroform. Add
this filtrate to the original filtrate and
evaporate the total down to a few milliliters on a low-temperature hotplate.
The last few milliliters should be evaporated in an oven maintained at approximately
221
°F.
Cool
the
evaporating dish in a desiccator for 30
minutes and weigh to the nearest 0.1
milligram to get the chloroform-soluble extractives residue (′). This ′ is substituted for e in the equations in paragraph (d)(5)(i) (a) and (b) of this section. If the chloroform-soluble extractives in milligrams per square inch
still exceeds the limitation prescribed
in paragraph (c) of this section, proceed
to paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section
(method for determining corrected
chloroform-soluble
extractives
residue).
(iii) Corrected chloroform-soluble extractives residue—(a) Correction for zinc
extractives. Ash the residue in the
evaporating dish by heating gently
over a Meker-type burner to destroy
organic matter and hold at red heat for
about 1 minute. Cool in the air for 3
minutes, and place the evaporating
dish in the desiccator for 30 minutes
and weigh to the nearest 0.1 milligram.
Analyze this ash for zinc by standard
Association of Official Agricultural
Chemists methods or equivalent. Calculate the zinc in the ash as zinc oleate, and subtract from the weight of
chloroform-soluble extractives residue
(′) to obtain the zinc-corrected chloroform-soluble extractives residue (e′).
This e′ is substituted for e in the equations in paragraph (d)(5)(i) (a) and (b) of
this section.

standard 50-milliliter buret with an inside diameter of 10–11 millimeters)
with
a
stopcock
of
glass,
perfluorocarbon resin, or equivalent
material. The column (or buret) may
be optionally equipped with an integral
coarse, fritted glass disc and the top of
the column (or buret) may be optionally fitted with a 100-millimeter solvent reservoir.
(2) Preparation of column. Place a
snug pledget of fine glass wool in the
bottom of the column (or buret) if the
column (or buret) is not equipped with
integral coarse, fritted glass disc. Overlay the glass wool pledget (or fritted
glass disc) with a 15–20 millimeter deep
layer of fine sand. Measure in a graduated
cylinder
15
milliliters
of
chromatographic
grade
aluminum
oxide (80–200 mesh) that has been tightly settled by tapping the cylinder.
Transfer the aluminum oxide to the
chromatographic tube, tapping the
tube during and after the transfer so as
to tightly settle the aluminum oxide.
Overlay the layer of aluminum oxide
with a 1.0–1.5 centimeter deep layer of
anhydrous sodium sulfate and on top of
this place an 8–10 millimeter thick plug
of fine glass wool. Next carefully add
about 25 milliliters of heptane to the
column with stopcock open, and allow
the heptane to pass through the column until the top level of the liquid
just passes into the top glass wool plug
in the column, and close stopcock.
(3) Chromatographing of sample extract—(i) For chloroform residues weighing 0.5 gram or less. To the dried and
weighed chloroform-soluble extract
residue in the evaporating dish, obtained in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this
section, add 20 milliliters of heptane
and stir. If necessary, heat carefully to
dissolve
the
residue.
Additional
heptane not to exceed a total volume of
50 milliliters may be used if necessary
to complete dissolving. Cool to room
temperature. (If solution becomes
cloudy, use the procedure in paragraph
(d)(5)(iii)(b)(3)(ii) of this section to obtain an aliquot of heptane solution calculated to contain 0.1–0.5 gram of chloroform-soluble extract residue.) Transfer the clear liquid solution to the column (or buret). Rinse the dish with 10
millimeters of additional heptane and
add to column. Allow the liquid to pass

through the column into a clean, tared
evaporating dish (platinum or Pyrex)
at a dropwise rate of about 2 milliliters
per minute until the liquid surface
reaches the top glass wool plug; then
close the stopcock temporarily. Rinse
the Pyrex flask which contained the
filtrate with an additional 10–15 milliliters of heptane and add to the column. Wash (elute) the column with
more heptane collecting about 100 milliliters of total eluate including that
already collected in the evaporating
dish. Evaporate the combined eluate in
the evaporating dish to dryness on a

the evaporating dish in a desiccator for
30 minutes and weigh the residue to the
nearest 0.1 milligram. Subtract the
weight of the residue from the weight
of chloroform-soluble extractives residue (′) to obtain the wax-, petrolatum, and mineral oil-corrected chloroformsoluble extractives residue (e′). This e′

more than 0.5 gram. Redissolve the
dried and weighed chloroform-soluble
extract residue as described in paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(b)(3)(i) of this section

flask (i.e., a 250-milliliter flask for
about 2.5 grams of residue) and adjust
to volume with additional heptane. Pipette out an aliquot (about 50 milliliters) calculated to contain 0.1–0.5
gram of the chloroform-soluble extract
residue
and
analyze
chromatographically as described in
paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(b)(3)(i) of this section. In this case the weight of the
dried residue from the heptane eluate
must be multiplied by the dilution factor to obtain the weight of wax, petrolatum, and mineral oil residue to be
subtracted from the weight of chloroform-soluble extractives residue (′) to
obtain the wax-, petrolatum-, and mineral oil-corrected chloroform-soluble

in
the
absorbances at any wavelength in the
region of 245 to 310 mμ shall be used as
a blank correction for the ultraviolet
absorbers measured at the same wavelength according to paragraph (c)(8)(ii)
of this section.
(iv) The acceptability of the solvents
for use in the permanganate test shall
be determined by preparing duplicate
permanganate test blanks according to
paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section. For
this test, the directions referring to
the sample extract shall be disregarded. The blanks shall be scanned

the extraction test without the plastic
sample. The procedure shall be as described in paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this
section, except that the appropriate exposed solvent shall be substituted
where the directions call for sample extract. The average difference in the
absorbances in the region of 544 to 552
mμ shall be used as a blank correction
for the determination of permanganate
oxidizable extractives according to
paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section.
(5) Extraction procedure. For each extraction, place a plastic sample in a
clean 25 millimeters × 200 millimeters
hard-glass test tube and add solvent
equal to 10 milliliters of solvent per
square inch of plastic surface. This
amount will be between 45 milliliters
and 55 milliliters. The solvent must be
preequilibrated to the temperature of
the extraction test. Close the test tube
with a ground-glass stopper and expose
to the specified temperature for the
specified time. Cool the tube and con-

Both cells are placed in the spectrophotometer cell compartment with the
sample solution in the reference beam.
The spectrophotometer is adjusted for
0 and 100 percent transmittance at 700
mμ. The spectrum is scanned on the absorbance scale from 700 mμ to 500 mμ in
such a way that the region 544 mμ to
552 mμ is scanned within 5 minutes to
10 minutes of the time that permanganate was added to the solutions. The
height of the absorbance peak shall be
measured, corrected for the blank as
determined in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of
this section, and multiplied by the ap-

propriate correction factor determined
according to paragraph (c)(7) (i), (ii),
and (iii) of this section. This test shall
be run in duplicate and the two results
averaged.

mμ in 5-centimeter silica spectrophotometric absorption cells versus a distilled water reference. The absorbance
at the wavelength of maximum absorbance (should be about 285 mμ) is about
0.11 but must be not less than 0.08 nor
more than 0.14. This test shall be run in
duplicate.
For
the
purpose
of
ascertaining compliance with the limitations prescribed in paragraph (b) (3)
and (4) of this section, the absorbance
obtained on the extracts according to

molecular weight extractives shall be
determined using size exclusion chromatography or an equivalent method.
When conducting the extraction test,
the copolymer, with no other absorptive media, shall be confined either in
a finished absorbent pad or in any suitable flexible porous article, (such as a

‘‘tea bag’’ or infuser), under an applied
pressure of 0.15 pounds per square inch
(for example, a 4×6 inch square pad is
subjected to a 1.6 kilograms applied
mass). The solvent used shall be at
least 60 milliliters aqueous sodium
chloride solution per gram of copolymer.
(d) Conditions of use. The copolymers

§ 176.170(c) of this chapter, except that
in the case of Nylon 6 films modified
with Nylon MXD–6 (complying with
§ 177.1500, item 10.2), the use complies
with the conditions of use specified in
table 2.
(iii) Extractives. Food contact films
described in paragraphs (c)(1) of this
section, when extracted with solvent or
solvents prescribed for the type of food
and under conditions of time and temperature specified for the intended use,
shall yield total extractives not to exceed 0.5 milligram per inch squared of
food-contact surface when tested by
the methods described in § 176.170(d) of
this chapter.
(iv) Optional adjuvant substances. The
substances employed in the production
of Nylon modifiers listed in paragraph
(c)(1) of this section may include:
(A) Substances generally recognized
as safe for use in food and food packaging;
(B) Substances subject to prior sanction or approval for use in Nylon resins
and used in accordance with such sanctions or approval; and
(C) Optional substances required in
the production of the additive identified in this paragraph and other optional substances that may be required
to accomplish the intended physical or
technical effect.
(d) Analytical methods—(1) Specific
gravity. Specific gravity shall be determined by weighing a 1-gram to 5-gram
sample first in air and then in freshly
boiled distilled water at 23 °C±2 °C.
(2) Melting point. The melting point
shall be determined as follows: Use a
hot-stage apparatus. The use of crossed
nicol prisms with a microscope hot
stage and reading of the thermometer
when the birefringence disappears increases the accuracy. If the crossed
nicol apparatus is not available, use
the lowest temperature at which the
sample becomes transparent or the
sharp edges or corners of the sample
become rounded as the melting point.
In case of doubt as to the onset of
melting, the sample is prodded with a
sharp instrument. If it sticks to the
heating block, it is considered to have
melted. If the melting point is low, dry
the sample in an oven at 85 °C for 24

hours in a nitrogen atmosphere then
repeat the test.
(3) Solubility in boiling 4.2N HCl. The
test shall be run on a sample approximately the size of a 1⁄8-inch cube in at
least 25 milliliters of 4.2 normal hydrochloric acid.
(4) Maximum extractable fraction in selected solvents. The procedure for determining the maximum extractable fraction of the nylon resins in selected solvents is as follows:
(i) Film should be cut with ordinary
scissors into pieces of a convenient size
such as 1⁄4-inch squares, for the extraction tests described in this section. The
granules of nylon molding powders are
in the proper form for the extraction
tests. Samples of fabricated articles
such as pipe, fittings, and other similar
articles must be cut to approximately
the size of the molding powder. This
can be done conveniently by using a
small-scale
commercial
plastics
granulator and cutting the sample
through a screen having 1⁄4-inch mesh.
Fine particles should be separated from
the cut resin by screening through a 20mesh screen. The material retained on
the screen is suitable for the extraction
tests.
(ii) The organic solvents must be of
American Chemical Society analytical
reagent grade; distilled water is used.
Approximately 30 grams of the prepared sample is weighed to the nearest
milligram. The weighed resin is transferred to a 500-milliliter round-bottom
flask equipped with a reflux condenser.
Approximately 300-milliliters of solvent is added to the flask and the contents refluxed gently for 8 hours with a
heating mantle. The solvent is then filtered off immediately while still hot,
using a Buchner funnel approximately
5 inches in diameter, a suction flask,
and a hardened filter paper (Whatman
No. 50 or equivalent). The paper is wet
with the solvent and a slight suction
applied just before starting the filtration. The resin is washed twice with
approximately 100-milliliter portions of
solvent and the combined filtrate and
washings are reduced to approximately
25 milliliters by evaporation at reduced
pressure (50 millimeters to 100 millimeters of mercury, absolute), heating as
necessary. The contents of the flask
are transferred to an evaporation dish

A sample is refluxed in the solvent for

the total residue weighed as a measure

(a) Apparatus. (1) Erlenmeyer flasks,
250-milliliter, with ground joint.
(2) Condensers, Allihn, 400-millimeter
jacket, with ground joint.
(3) Funnels, ribbed 75-millimeter diameter, stem cut to 40 millimeters.
(4) Funnels, Buchner type, with

equivalent.
(c) Procedure. Weigh 1 gram of sample
accurately and place in a 250-milliliter
Erlenmeyer flask containing two or
three boiling stones. Add 100 milliliters
of solvent, attach the flask to the condenser (use no grease), and reflux the
mixture for 2 hours. Remove the flask

hot, through a small wad of glass wool
packed in a short-stem funnel into a
tared 150-millimeter beaker. Rinse the
flask and filter with two 10-milliliter
portions of the hot solvent, and add the
rinsings to the filtrate. Evaporate the
filtrate on a stream bath with the aid
of a stream of nitrogen. Dry the residue in a vacuum oven at 110 °C for 2
hours, cool in a desiccator, and weigh
to the nearest 0.0001 gram. Determine

§ 177.1520

maximum n-hexane-extractable fraction may be determined by the methods set forth in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(a)
through (d)(3)(ii)(i) of this section.
(a) Extraction apparatus. Two-liter,
straight-walled, Pyrex (or equivalent)
resin kettles, fitted with three-hole
ground-glass covers are most convenient for this purpose. The cover is
fitted with a thermometer, a gas-tight
stirrer driven by an air motor or explosion-proof electric motor, and a reflux
condenser. The kettle is fitted with an
electric heating mantle of appropriate
size and shape, which is controlled by a
variable-voltage transformer.
(b) Evaporating apparatus. Rapid
evaporation of large volumes of solvent
requires special precautions to prevent
contamination by dust. This is facilitated by a special ‘‘gas’’ cover consisting of an inverted flat Pyrex crystallizing dish of an appropriate size (190
millimeters × 100 millimeters) to fit a
1-liter beaker. Through the center of
the dish are sealed an inlet tube for
preheated, oxygen-free nitrogen, and
an outlet tube located 1 inch off center.
Nitrogen is fed from the supply source
through a coil of 1⁄4-inch stainless steel
tubing immersed in the same steam
bath used to supply heat for solvent
evaporation. All connections are made
with flexible tetrafluoroethylene tubing.
(c) Reagents—(1) n-Hexane. Spectrograde n-hexane.
(2) Nitrogen. High-purity dry nitrogen
containing less than 10 parts per million of oxygen.
(d) Procedure. Transfer 2.5 grams (accurately weighed to nearest 0.001 gram)
of the polymer to the resin kettle. Add
1 liter of solvent and clamp top in position. Start water flowing through jacket of the reflux condenser and apply air
pressure to the stirring motor to
produce vigorous agitation. Turn on
heating jacket with transformer set at
a predetermined voltage to bring the
temperature of the contents to 50 °C
within 20–25 minutes. As the thermometer reading approaches 45 °C–47 °C, reduce the voltage to the predetermined
setting that will just maintain the
temperature at 50 °C. Do not overshoot
the prescribed temperature. Should
this occur discard the test and start
afresh. Exactly 2 hours after the sol-

vent temperature has reached 50 °C,
disconnect the heater, remove the resin
kettle from the heating jacket, and decant the solvent, while still warm,
through a coarse filter paper placed on
top of a fritted-glass funnel, collecting
the filtrate in a tared, glass-stoppered
Erlenmeyer flask of 1-liter capacity.
Determine the weight of the filtrate recovered to the nearest gram. Recovery
should be at least 90 percent of the
original solvent. Losses due to evaporation during heating and filtering
have been found not to exceed 10 percent. Transfer about half of the solvent
filtrate to a 1-liter beaker placed on an
opening in the steam bath and immediately cover with the special ‘‘gas’’
cover, the inlet tube of which has been
attached with flexible tetrafluoroethylene tubing to a source of high-purity nitrogen in series with a stainless
steel heating coil immersed directly in
the body of the steam bath. Maintain a
positive flow of warm nitrogen gas
throughout the evaporation of the solvent, adding the remainder of the filtrate from the Erlenmeyer flask as the
evaporation proceeds. When the volume
of the solvent has been reduced to
about 50 milliliters, transfer the concentrated liquid to a previously tared
weighing dish of suitable size. Wash the
beaker twice with 20–30 milliliter portions of warm solvent, adding the
washings to the weighing dish while
continuing to evaporate the remainder
of the solvent under the gas cover with
its flow of warm nitrogen directed toward the center of the dish. In the
event that an insoluble residue that
cannot be removed with warm solvent
remains in the beaker, it may be necessary to heat with a small amount of
a higher boiling solvent such as benzene or toluene, transferring these
washings to the weighing dish before
final evaporation to dryness. Transfer
the weighing dish with its residue to a
vacuum desiccator, and allow it to remain overnight (at least 12 hours),
after which the net weight of the dry
residue is determined to the nearest
0.0001 gram. Correct the result for any
solvent blank equivalent to the nonvolatile matter determined to be contained in the amount of solvents used
in the test.

to give a smooth and uniform stir rate.
Allow the n-hexane to preheat for 1
hour to bring the temperature to 49.5
°C±0.5 °C. Temperature is a critical factor in this analysis and it must not
vary more than 1 °C. If the temperature
exceeds these limits, the test must be
discontinued and restarted. Blown,
compression molded, or extrusion cast
films can be tested. Ideally, the film

should be prepared by the same process
as will be used with the production
resin. Using gloves and metal tweezers
to avoid sample contamination, cut
about 2.7 grams of the prepared film (4
mils or less in thickness) into about 1inch squares using clean sharp scissors.
Proceed with Option 1 or 2.
Option 1. Using tweezers and noting
the number of film pieces, transfer 2.5
grams (accurately weighed to 0.1 milligram) of polymer to the extraction vessel. Extract the film sample for 2
hours. Allow the vessel to cool and filter the contents through a fritted porcelain funnel. Wash the film pieces
with fresh n-hexane, aspirate to dryness, and transfer, using tweezers, to a
beaker. Recount the film pieces to
verify that none were lost during the
transfer. Place the beaker in the vacuum oven for 2 hours at 80 °C ±5 °C. After
2 hours, remove and place in a desiccator to cool to room temperature
(about 1 hour). After cooling, reweigh
the film pieces to the nearest 0.1 milligram. Calculate the percent hexaneextractables content from the weight
loss of the original sample. Multiply
the result by 0.935 and compare with
extraction limits in paragraph (c) of
this section. Repeat the above procedure for successive samples.
Option 2. Transfer 2.5±0.05 grams of
the prepared 1-inch film sections into a
tared sample basket and accurately
weigh to the nearest 0.1 milligram.
Carefully raise the condenser until the
hook on the positioning rod is above
the neck of the 2-liter extraction vessel. The basket should be totally below
the level of n-hexane solvent. Extract
the sample resin film for 2 hours and
then raise the basket above the solvent
level to drain momentarily. Remove
the basket and rinse the contents by
immersing several times in fresh nhexane. Allow the basket to dry between rinsings. Remove the excess solvent by briefly blowing the basket with
a stream of nitrogen or dry air. Place
the basket in the vacuum oven for 2
hours at 80 °C ±5 °C. After 2 hours, remove and place in a desiccator to cool
to room temperature (about 1 hour).
After cooling, reweigh the basket to
the nearest 0.1 milligram. Calculate

(4) Maximum soluble fraction in xylene—(i) Olefin copolymers described in
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, polypropylene, and poly(methylpen-tene). A
sample is dissolved completely in xylene by heating and stirring in a bottle
with little free space. The solution is
allowed to cool without stirring,
whereupon the insoluble portion precipitates and is filtered off; the total
solids content of the filtrate is then determined as a measure of the soluble

thylamine in 1 liter of industrial grade
xylene having specific gravity 0.856–
0.867 (20 °C/20 °C) and boiling range 123
°C–160 °C.
(c) Procedure. Weigh 1 to 2 grams of
sample to the nearest 0.001 gram and
place in a 125-milliliter Pyrex reagent
bottle containing a 1-inch long tetrafluoroethylene-resin-coated
stirring
bar. Add 100 milliliters of solvent, set
the stopper in lightly, and place the
bottle in the heating mantle or aluminum block maintained at a temperature of 120 °C, and stir with a magnetic
stirrer until the sample is completely
dissolved. Remove the bottle from the
heat and allow it to cool 1 hour in the
air, without stirring. Then place the
bottle in a water bath maintained at 25
°C ±0.5 °C, and allow to stand 1 hour
without stirring. Next, remove the bottle from the water bath, shake, and
pour part of the contents into the
coarse-porosity fritted-glass funnel.
Apply suction, and draw 30–40 milliliters of filtrate through, adding more
slurry to the funnel, and catching the
filtrate in a large test tube. (If the
slurry is hard to filter, add 10 grams of
diatomaceous earth filter aid to the
bottle and shake vigorously just prior
to the filtration.) Pipet a suitable aliquot (preferably 20 milliliters) of the
filtrate into a tared aluminum disposable dish. Place the dish on a steam
bath covered with a fresh sheet of aluminum foil and invert a short-stemmed
4-inch funnel over the dish. Pass nitrogen (heated if desired) down through
the funnel at a rate sufficient to just
ripple the surface of the solvent. When
the liquid has evaporated, place the
dish in a vacuum oven at 140 °C and
less than 50 millimeters mercury pressure for 2 hours. Cool in a desiccator
and weigh. (Note: If the residue value
seems high, redry in the vacuum oven
for one-half hour to ensure complete
removal of all xylene solvent.) Calculation:

(ii) Olefin copolymers described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section and polyethylene. A sample is extracted in xylene at reflux temperature for 2 hours
and filtered. The filtrate is evaporated
and the total residue weighed as a
measure of soluble fraction.
(a) Apparatus—(1) Extraction apparatus. Two-liter, straight-walled Pyrex
(or equivalent) resin kettles, fitted
with ground-glass covers, are most convenient for this purpose. The cover is
equipped with a thermometer and an
efficient reflux condenser. The kettle is
fitted with an electric heating mantle
of appropriate size and shape which is
controlled by a variable-voltage transformer.
(2) Constant temperature water bath. It
must be large enough to permit immersion of the extraction kettle and set to
maintain 25 °C ±0.1 °C.
(3) Evaporating apparatus. Gas cover
consisting of a flat Pyrex crystallizing
dish (190 millimeters × 100 millimeters)
inverted to fit over a 1-liter beaker
with 8-millimeter gas inlet tube sealed
through center and an outlet tube 1
inch off center. The beaker with gas
cover is inserted in an electric heating
mantle equipped with a variable-voltage transformer. The outlet tube is attached to an efficient condenser
mounted on a receiving flask for solvent recovery and having an outlet for
connection to an aspirator pump. The
heating mantle (with the beaker) is
mounted on a magnetic stirring device.
An infrared heat lamp is mounted
vertically 3–4 inches above the gas
cover to prevent condensation of the
solvent inside the cover. Make all connections with flexible tetrafluoroethylene tubing.
(b) Reagents—(1) Xylene. American
Chemical Society reagent grade that
has
been
redistilled
through
a
fractionating column to reduce the
nonvolatile residue.
(2) Nitrogen. High-purity dry nitrogen
containing less than 104 parts per million oxygen.
(c) Procedure. Transfer 5 grams ±0.001
gram of sample to the resin kettle, add
1,000 milliliters (840 grams) of xylene,
and clamp top in position after inserting a piece of glass rod to prevent
bumping during reflux. Start water
flowing through the jacket of the

reflux condenser and apply full voltage
(115 volts) to the heating mantle. When
the xylene starts to boil, reduce the
voltage to a level just sufficient to
maintain reflux. After refluxing for at
least 2 hours, disconnect the power
source to the mantle, remove the kettle, and allow to cool in air until the
temperature of the contents drops to 50
°C, after which the kettle may be rapidly cooled to 25 °C–30 °C by immersing
in a cold water bath. Transfer the kettle to a constant temperature bath set
to maintain 25 °C ±0.1 °C, and allow to
equilibrate for a least 1 hour (may be
left overnight if convenient). Break up
any precipitated polymers that may
have formed, and decant the xylene solution successively through a fast filter
paper and then through a fritted-glass
filter into a tared 1-liter Erlenmeyer
flask, collecting only the first 450 milliliters—500 milliliters of filtrate (any
attempt to collect more of the xylene
solution usually results in clogging the
filter and risking losses). Reweigh the
Erlenmeyer flask and calculate the
weight of the filtrate obtained to the
nearest 0.1 gram. Transfer the filtrate,
quantitatively, from the Erlenmeyer
flask to the 1-liter beaker, insert the
beaker in its heating mantle, add a
glass-coated magnetic stirring bar, and
mount the gas cover in place, connecting the inlet tube to the nitrogen
source and the outlet to the condenser
of the receiving flask. Start a flow of
nitrogen (2 to 3 liters per minute) into
the gas cover and connect an aspirator
to the receiver using a free-flow rate
equivalent to 6–7 liters of air per
minute. With the infrared lamp on, adjust the voltage to the heating mantle
to give a distillation rate of 12–13 milliliters per minute when the magnetic
stirrer is revolving just fast enough to
promote good boiling. When the volume of solvent in the beaker has been
reduced to 30–50 milliliters, transfer
the concentrated extractive to a suitable weighing dish that has been previously tared (dry). Rinse the beaker
twice with 10–20 milliliter portions of
fresh xylene, adding the rinsings to the
weighing dish. Evaporate the remainder of the xylene on an electric
hotplate set at low heat under the gas
cover with a stream of nitrogen directed toward the center of the dish.

(2) Extractives limitations. The following extractives limitations are determined by the methods described in
paragraph (d) of this section:
(i) Total extractives do not exceed
0.10 weight-percent when extracted
with n-heptane at 150 °F for 2 hours.
(ii) Total extractives do not exceed
0.03 weight-percent when extracted
with water at 150 °F for 2 hours.
(iii) Total extractives obtained by extracting with water at 150 °F for 2
hours contain no more than 0.5 milligram of vinyl chloride-ethylene copolymer per 100 grams of sample tested as
determined from the organic chlorine
content. The organic chlorine content
is determined as described in paragraph
(d)(3) of this section.
(d) Analytical methods: The analytical methods for determining whether
vinyl chloride-ethylene basic copolymers conform to the extractives limitations prescribed in paragraph (c) of
this section are as follows and are applicable to the basic copolymers in
powder form having a particle size such
that 100 percent will pass through a
U.S. Standard Sieve No. 40 and 80 percent will pass through a U.S. Standard
Sieve No. 80:
(1) Reagents—(i) Water. All water used
in
these
procedures
shall
be
demineralized (deionized), freshly distilled water.
(ii) n-Heptane. Reagent grade, freshly
distilled n-heptane shall be used.
(2) Determination of total amount of extractives. All determinations shall be
done in duplicate using duplicate
blanks. Approximately 400 grams of
sample (accurately weighed) shall be
placed in a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask.
Add 1,200 milliliters of solvent and
cover the flask with aluminum foil.
The covered flask and contents are suspended in a thermostated bath and are
kept, with continual shaking at 150 °F
for 2 hours. The solution is then filtered through a No. 42 Whatman filter
paper, and the filtrate is collected in a
graduated cylinder. The total amount
of filtrate (without washing) is measured and called A milliliters. The filtrate is transferred to a Pyrex (or
equivalent) beaker and evaporated on a
steam bath under a stream of nitrogen

(3) Vinyl chloride-ethylene copolymer
content of aqueous extract—(i) Principle.
The vinyl chloride-ethylene copolymer
content of the aqueous extract can be
determined by determining the organic
chlorine content and calculating the
amount of copolymer equivalent to the
organic chlorine content.
(ii) Total organic chlorine content. A
weighed sample of approximately 400
grams is extracted with 1,200 milliliters
of water at 150 °F for 2 hours, filtered,
and the volume of filtrate is measured
(A milliliters) as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(a) A slurry of Amberlite IRA–400, or
equivalent, is made with distilled
water in a 150-milliliter beaker. The
slurry is added to a chromatographic
column until it is filled to about half
its length. This should give a volume of
resin of 15–25 milliliters. The liquid
must not be allowed to drain below the
top of the packed column.
(b) The column is regenerated to the
basic (OH) form by slowly passing
through it (10–15 milliliters per minute)
10 grams of sodium hydroxide dissolved
in 200 milliliters of water. The column
is washed with distilled water until the
effluent is neutral to phenolphthalein.
One drop of methyl red indicator is
added to the A milliliters of filtered
aqueous extract and, if on the basic
side (yellow), nitric acid is added drop
by drop until the solution turns pink.
(c) The extract is deionized by passing it through the exchange column at
a rate of 10–15 milliliters per minute.
The column is washed with 200 milliliters of distilled water. The deionized

extract and washings are collected in a
1,500-milliliter beaker. The solution is
evaporated carefully on a steam plate
to a volume of approximately 50 milliliters and then transferred quantitatively, a little at a time, to a clean
22-milliliter Parr cup, also on the
steam plate. The solution is evaporated
to dryness. Next 0.25 gram of sucrose
and 0.5 gram of benzoic acid are added
to the cup. One scoop (approximately
15 grams) of sodium peroxide is then
added to the cup. The bomb is assembled and ignition is conducted in the
usual fashion.
(d) After the bomb has cooled, it is
rinsed thoroughly with distilled water
and disassembled. The top of the bomb
is rinsed into a 250-milliliter beaker
with distilled water. The beaker is
placed on the steam plate. The bomb
cup is placed in the beaker and carefully tipped over to allow the water to
leach out the combustion mixture.
After the bubbling has stopped, the cup
is removed from the beaker and rinsed
thoroughly. The solution is cooled to
room temperature and cautiously neutralized with concentrated nitric acid
by slowly pouring the acid down a stirring rod until the bubbling ceases. The
solution is cooled and an equal volume
of acetone is added.
(e) The solution is titrated with 0.005
N silver nitrate using standard potentiometric titration techniques with a
silver electrode as indicator and a potassium nitrate modified calomel electrode as a reference electrode. An expanded scale recording titrimeter.

(3) Vinyl chloride-propylene copolymer
content of aqueous extract—(i) Principle.
The vinyl chloride-propylene copolymer content of the aqueous extract can
be determined by determining the organic chlorine content and calculating
the amount of copolymer equivalent to
the organic chlorine content. The organic chlorine content is the difference
between the total chlorine content and
the ionic chlorine content.
(ii) Total chlorine content. A weighed
sample is extracted with water at 150
°F for 2 hours, filtered, and the volume
of filtrate is measured (A milliliters) as
described in paragraph (d)(2) of this
section. Two drops of 50 percent by
weight sodium hydroxide solution are
added to prevent loss of chloride from
ammonium chloride, if present, and the
solution is evaporated to approximately 15 milliliters. The concentrated
filtrate is quantitatively transferred to
a 22-milliliter Parr bomb fusion cup
and gently evaporated to dryness. To
the contents of the cup are added 3.5
grams of granular sodium peroxide, 0.1
gram of powdered starch, and 0.02 gram
potassium nitrate; and the contents
are mixed thoroughly. The bomb is as-

sembled, water is added to the recess at
the top of the bomb and ignition is conducted in the usual fashion using a
Meeker burner. The heating is continued for 1 minute after the water at the
top has evaporated. The bomb is
quenched in water, rinsed with distilled
water, and placed in a 400-milliliter
beaker. The bomb cover is rinsed with
water, catching the washings in the
same 400-milliliter beaker. The bomb is
covered with distilled water and a
watch glass and heated until the melt
has dissolved. The bomb is removed,
rinsed, catching the rinsings in the
beaker, and the solution is acidified
with concentrated nitric acid using
methyl purple as an indicator. The
beaker is covered with a watch glass,
and the contents are boiled gently for
10–15 minutes. After cooling to room
temperature the solution is made
slightly alkaline with 50 percent by

then acidified with dilute (1:5) nitric
acid. Then 1.5 milliliters of 2 N nitric

equal milliequivalents of total chlorine
in aqueous extract of 100 grams of sample (as calculated in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)

milliequivalents of organic chlorine in
aqueous extract of 100 grams of sample
(as calculated in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) (a)
of this section) multiplied by 84.5.
NOTE: The conversion factor, 84.5, is derived from the equivalent weight of chlorine
divided by the chlorine content of the
heptane extractable fraction.)

§ 178.3297

Colorants for polymers.

The substances listed in paragraph
(e) of this section may be safely used as
colorants in the manufacture of articles or components of articles intended
for use in producing, manufacturing,
packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food, subject to the provisions and
definitions set forth in this section:
(a) The term colorant means a dye,
pigment, or other substance that is
used to impart color to or to alter the
color of a food-contact material, but
that does not migrate to food in
amounts that will contribute to that
food any color apparent to the naked
eye. For the purpose of this section,
the term ‘‘colorant’’ includes substances such as optical brighteners and
fluorescent whiteners, which may not
themselves be colored, but whose use is
intended to affect the color of a foodcontact material.

(b) The colorant must be used in accordance with current good manufacturing practice, including use levels
which are not in excess of those reasonably required to accomplish the intended coloring effect.
(c) Colorants in this section must
conform to the description and specifications indicated. If a polymer described in this section is itself the subject of a regulation promulgated under
section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act, it shall also comply
with any specifications and limitations
prescribed by that regulation. Extraction testing guidelines to conduct studies for additional uses of colorants
under this section are available from
the Food and Drug Administration free
of charge from the Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition, (HFS–
200) Food and Drug Administration,

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

Because of the sensitivity of the test, the
possibility of errors arising from contamination is great. It is of the greatest importance
that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to
remove all organic matter such as oil,
grease, detergent residues, etc. Examine all
glassware, including stoppers and stopcocks,
under ultraviolet light to detect any residual
fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is
to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care
to avoid contamination of oil samples in
handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate
packaging is essential. Because some of the
polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test
are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the
entire procedure is to be carried out under
subdued light.
APPARATUS

Separatory funnels. 250-milliliter, 500-milliliter, 1,000-milliliter, and preferably 2,000milliliter capacity, equipped with tetrafluoroethylene polymer stopcocks.
Reservoir. 500-milliliter capacity, equipped
with a 24/40 standard taper male fitting at
the bottom and a suitable ball-joint at the
top for connecting to the nitrogen supply.
The male fitting should be equipped with
glass hooks.

REAGENTS AND MATERIALS

Organic solvents. All solvents used throughout the procedure shall meet the specifications and tests described in this specification. The isooctane, benzene, acetone, and
methyl alcohol designated in the list following this paragraph shall pass the following test:
To the specified quantity of solvent in a
250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask, add 1 milliliter of purified n-hexadecane and evaporate
on the steam bath under a stream of nitrogen (a loose aluminum foil jacket around the
flask will speed evaporation). Discontinue
evaporation when not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. (To the residue from benzene
add a 10-milliliter portion of purified isooctane, reevaporate, and repeat once to insure complete removal of benzene.)
Alternatively, the evaporation time can be
reduced by using the optional evaporation
flask. In this case the solvent and n-hexadecane are placed in the flask on the steam
bath, the tube assembly is inserted, and a
stream of nitrogen is fed through the inlet
tube while the outlet tube is connected to a
solvent trap and vacuum line in such a way
as to prevent any flow-back of condensate
into the flask.
Dissolve the 1 milliliter of hexadecane residue in isooctane and make to 25 milliliters
volume. Determine the absorbance in the 5centimeter path length cells compared to
isooctane as reference. The absorbance of the
solution of the solvent residue (except for
methyl alcohol) shall not exceed 0.01 per centimeter path length between 280 and 400 mμ.
For methyl alcohol this absorbance value
shall be 0.00.
Isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane). Use 180
milliliters for the test described in the preceding paragraph. Purify, if necessary, by
passage through a column of activated silica
gel (Grade 12, Davison Chemical Company,
Baltimore, Maryland, or equivalent) about 90
centimeters in length and 5 centimeters to 8
centimeters in diameter.
Benzene, A.C.S. reagent grade. Use 150 milliliters for the test. Purify, if necessary, by
distillation or otherwise.
Acetone, A.C.S. reagent grade. Use 200 milliliters for the test. Purify, if necessary, by
distillation.
Eluting mixtures:
1. 10 percent benzene in isooctane. Pipet 50
milliliters of benzene into a 250-milliliter
glass-stoppered volumetric flask and adjust
to volume with isooctane, with mixing.
2. 20 percent benzene in isooctane. Pipet 50
milliliters of benzene into a 250-milliliter
glass-stoppered volumetric flask and adjust
to volume with isooctane, with mixing.
3. Acetone-benzene-water mixture. Add 20
milliliters of water to 380 milliliters of acetone and 200 milliliters of benzene, and mix.

There shall be no irregularities in the absorbance curve within these wavelengths.
Phosphoric acid. 85 percent A.C.S. reagent

grams of the magnesium oxide in a large
beaker, add 700 milliliters of distilled water
to make a thin slurry, and heat on a steam
bath for 30 minutes with intermittent stirring. Stir well initially to insure that all the
adsorbent is completely wetted. Using a
Buchner funnel and a filter paper (Schleicher
& Schuell No. 597, or equivalent) of suitable
diameter, filter with suction. Continue suction until water no longer drips from the
funnel. Transfer the adsorbent to a glass
trough lined with aluminum foil (free from
rolling oil). Break up the magnesia with a
clean spatula and spread out the adsorbent
on the aluminum foil in a layer about 1 centimeter to 2 centimeters thick. Dry for 24
hours at 160 °C ±1 °C. Pulverize the magnesia
with mortar and pestle. Sieve the pulverized
adsorbent between 60–180 mesh. Use the magnesia retained on the 180-mesh sieve.
Celite 545. Johns Mansville Company, diatomaceous earth, or equivalent.
Magnesium oxide-Celite 545 mixture (2+1) by
weight. Place the magnesium oxide (60–180
mesh) and the Celite 545 in 2 to 1 proportions, respectively, by weight in a glassstoppered flask large enough for adequate
mixing. Shake vigorously for 10 minutes.
Transfer the mixture to a glass trough lined
with aluminum foil (free from rolling oil)
and spread it out on a layer about 1 centi-

meter to 2 centimeters thick. Reheat the
mixture at 160 °C ±1 °C for 2 hours, and store
in a tightly closed flask.
Sodium sulfate, anhydrous, A.C.S. reagent
grade, preferably in granular form. For each
bottle of sodium sulfate reagent used, establish as follows the necessary sodium sulfate
prewash to provide such filters required in
the method: Place approximately 35 grams of
anhydrous sodium sulfate in a 30-milliliter
course, fritted-glass funnel or in a 65-millimeter filter funnel with glass wool plug;
wash with successive 15-milliliter portions of
the indicated solvent until a 15-milliliter
portion of the wash shows 0.00 absorbance
per centimeter path length between 280 mμ
and 400 mμ when tested as prescribed under
‘‘Organic solvents.’’ Usually three portions
of wash solvent are sufficient.
Before proceeding with analysis of a sample, determine the absorbance in a 5-centimeter path cell between 250 millimicrons and
400 millimicrons for the reagent blank by
carrying out the procedure, without an oil
sample, recording the spectra after the extraction stage and after the complete procedure as prescribed. The absorbance per centimeter pathlength following the extraction
stage should not exceed 0.02 in the wavelength range from 280 mμ to 400 mμ; the absorbance per centimeter pathlength following the complete procedure should not
exceed 0.02 in the wavelength range from 280
mμ to 400 mμ. If in either spectrum the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250 mμ–260
mμ region are present, remove the benzene
by the procedure under ‘‘Organic solvents’’
and record absorbance again.
Place 300 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide
in a 1-liter separatory funnel and add 75 milliliters of phosphoric acid. Mix the contents
of the funnel and allow to stand for 10 minutes. (The reaction between the sulfoxide
and the acid is exothermic. Release pressure
after mixing, then keep funnel stoppered.)
Add 150 milliliters of isooctane and shake to
pre-equilibrate the solvents. Draw off the individual layers and store in glass-stoppered
flasks.
Weigh a 20-gram sample of the oil and
transfer to a 500-milliliter separatory funnel
containing 100 milliliters of pre-equilibrated
sulfoxide-phosphoric acid mixture. Complete
the transfer of the sample with small portions of preequilibrated isooctane to give a
total volume of the oil and solvent of 75 milliliters. Shake the funnel vigorously for 2
minutes. Set up three 250-milliliter separatory funnels with each containing 30 milliliters of pre-equilibrated isooctane. After
separation of liquid phases, carefully draw
off lower layer into the first 250-milliliter
separatory funnel and wash in tandem with
the 30-milliliter portions of isooctane contained in the 250-milliliter separatory funnels. Shaking time for each wash is 1
minute. Repeat the extraction operation

with two additional portions of the sulfoxide-acid mixture and wash each extractive
in tandem through the same three portions
of isooctane.
Collect the successive extractives (300 milliliters total) in a separatory funnel (preferably 2-liter) containing 480 milliliters of
distilled water; mix, and allow to cool for a
few minutes after the last extractive has
been added. Add 80 milliliters of isooctane to
the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Draw off the
lower aqueous layer into a second separatory
funnel (preferably 2-liter) and repeat the extraction with 80 milliliters of isooctane.
Draw off and discard the aqueous layer.
Wash each of the 80-milliliter extractives
three times with 100-milliliter portions of
distilled water. Shaking time for each wash
is 1 minute. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extractive through anhydrous
sodium sulfate prewashed with isooctane (see
Sodium sulfate under ‘‘Reagents and Materials’’ for preparation of filter) into a 250milliliter Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally
into the evaporation flask). Wash the first
separatory funnel with the second 80-milliliter isooctane extractive and pass through
the sodium sulfate. Then wash the second
and first separatory funnels successively
with a 20-milliliter portion of isooctane and
pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate
into the flask. Add 1 milliliter of n-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane on the
steam bath under nitrogen. Discontinue
evaporation when not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10-milliliter portion of isooctane, reevaporate to 1
milliliter of hexadecane, and repeat this operation once.
Quantitatively transfer the residue with
isooctane to a 200-milliliter volumetric
flask, make to volume, and mix. Determine
the absorbance of the solution in the 1-centimeter pathlength cells compared to isooctane as reference between 280 mμ–400 mμ
(take care to lose none of the solution in filling the sample cell). Correct the absorbance
values for any absorbance derived from reagents as determined by carrying out the
procedure without an oil sample. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits
prescribed in this paragraph, the oil meets
the ultraviolet absorbance specifications. If
the corrected absorbance per centimeter
pathlength exceeds the limits prescribed in
this paragraph, proceed as follows: Quantitatively transfer the isooctane solution to
a 125-milliliter flask equipped with 24/40
joint, and evaporate the isooctane on the
steam bath under a stream of nitrogen to a
volume of 1 milliliter of hexadecane. Add 10
milliliters of methyl alcohol and approximately 0.3 gram of sodium borohydride.
(Minimize exposure of the borohydride to the
atmosphere. A measuring dipper may be
used.) Immediately fit a water-cooled con-

denser equipped with a 24/40 joint and with a
drying tube into the flask, mix until the
borohydride is dissolved, and allow to stand
for 30 minutes at room temperature, with
intermittent swirling. At the end of this period, disconnect the flask and evaporate the
methyl alcohol on the steam bath under nitrogen until the sodium borohydride begins
to come out of the solution. Then add 10 milliliters of isooctane and evaporate to a volume of about 2–3 milliliters. Again, add 10
milliliters of isooctane and concentrate to a
volume of approximately 5 milliliters. Swirl
the flask repeatedly to assure adequate
washing of the sodium borohydride residues.
Fit the tetrafluoroethylene polymer disc
on the upper part of the stem of the
chromatographic tube, then place the tube
with the disc on the suction flask and apply
the vacuum (approximately 135 millimeters
Hg pressure). Weigh out 14 grams of the 2:1
magnesium oxide-Celite 545 mixture and
pour the adsorbent mixture into the
chromatographic tube in approximately 3centimeter layers. After the addition of each
layer, level off the top of the adsorbent with
a flat glass rod or metal plunger by pressing
down firmly until the adsorbent is well
packed. Loosen the topmost few millimeters
of each adsorbent layer with the end of a
metal rod before the addition of the next
layer. Continue packing in this manner until
all the 14 grams of the adsorbent is added to
the tube. Level off the top of the adsorbent
by pressing down firmly with a flat glass rod
or metal plunger to make the depth of the
adsorbent bed approximately 12.5 centimeters in depth. Turn off the vacuum and remove the suction flask. Fit the 500–milliliter
reservoir
onto
the
top
of
the
chromatographic column and prewet the column by passing 100 milliliters of isooctane
through the column. Adjust the nitrogen
pressure so that the rate of descent of the
isooctane coming off the column is between
2–3 milliliters per minute. Discontinue pressure just before the last of the isooctane
reaches the level of the adsorbent. (Caution:
Do not allow the liquid level to recede below
the adsorbent level at any time.) Remove the
reservoir and decant the 5–milliliter isooctane concentrate solution onto the column
and with slight pressure again allow the liquid level to recede to barely above the adsorbent level. Rapidly complete the transfer
similarly with two 5–milliliter portions of
isooctane, swirling the flask repeatedly each
time to assure adequate washing of the residue. Just before the final 5–milliliter wash
reaches the top of the adsorbent, add 100 milliliters of isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at the 2–3 milliliters
per minute rate. Just before the last of the
isooctane reaches the adsorbent level, add

100 milliliters of 10 percent benzene in isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at the aforementioned rate. Just before the solvent mixture reaches adsorbent
level, add 25 milliliters of 20 percent benzene
in isooctane to the reservoir and continue
the percolation at 2–3 milliliters per minute
until all this solvent mixture has been removed from the column. Discard all the
elution solvents collected up to this point.
Add 300 milliliters of the acetone-benzenewater mixture to the reservoir and percolate
through
the
column
to
eluate
the
polynuclear compounds. Collect the eluate in
a clean 1-liter separatory funnel. Allow the
column to drain until most of the solvent
mixture is removed. Wash the eluate three
times with 300-milliliter portions of distilled
water, shaking well for each wash. (The addition of small amounts of sodium chloride facilitates separation.) Discard the aqueous
layer after each wash. After the final separation, filter the residual benzene through anhydrous sodium sulfate pre-washed with benzene (see Sodium sulfate under ‘‘Reagents
and Materials’’ for preparation of filter) into
a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into the evaporation flask). Wash the
separatory funnel with two additional 20milliliter portions of benzene which are also
filtered through the sodium sulfate. Add 1
milliliter of n-hexadecane and completely remove the benzene by evaporation under nitrogen, using the special procedure to eliminate benzene as previously described under
‘‘Organic solvents.’’ Quantitatively transfer
the residue with isooctane to a 200-milliliter
volumetric flask and adjust to volume. Determine the absorbance of the solution in the
1-centimeter pathlength cells compared to
isooctane as reference between 250 mμ–400
mμ. Correct for any absorbance derived from
the reagents as determined by carrying out
the procedure without an oil sample. If either spectrum shows the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250 mμ–260 mμ region, evaporate the solution to remove benzene by the
procedure under ‘‘Organic solvents.’’ Dissolve the residue, transfer quantitatively,
and adjust to volume in isooctane in a 200milliliter volumetric flask. Record the absorbance again. If the corrected absorbance
does not exceed the limits proposed in this

level of about 0.4, absorbance measurements
shall be repeatable within ±0.01 and accurate
within ±0.05. Wavelength measurements shall
be repeatable with ±0.2 mμ and accurate
within ±1.0 mμ. Instrument operating conditions are selected to realize this performance
under dynamic (automatic) recording operations. Accuracy of absorbance measurements are determined at 290, 345, and 400 mμ,
using potassium chromate as the reference
standard. (National Bureau of Standards Circular 484, Spectrophotometry, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1949.)
G. Two fused quartz cells having
pathlengths of 1.00±0.005 centimeter or better.
II. Purity of reagents and materials. Reagentgrade chemicals shall be used in all tests. It
is further specified that each chemical shall
be tested for purity in accordance with the
instruction given under ‘‘Reagents and Materials’’ in III below. In addition, a blank run
by the procedure shall be made on each purified lot of reagents and materials. Unless
otherwise indicated, references to water
shall be understood to mean distilled water.
III. Reagents and materials— A. Organic solvents. All solvents used throughout the procedure shall meet the specifications and
tests described in this section III. The isooctane, benzene, cyclohexane, nitromethane,
and n-hexadecane designated shall pass the
following test: To the specified quantity of
solvent in a 150-milliliter beaker, add 1 milliliter of purified n-hexadecane and evaporate
on the steam bath under a stream of nitrogen. Discontinue evaporation when not over
1 milliliter of residue remains (to the residue
from benzene and nitromethane add a 10-milliliter portion of purified isooctane, re-evaporate, and repeat once to insure complete removal of solvent). Dissolve the 1 milliliter of

n-hexadecane residue in isooctane and make
to 10-milliliter volume. Determine the absorbance in 1.0-centimeter pathlength cells
compared to water as reference. The absorbance of the solution of solvent residue shall
not exceed 0.05 between 280 and 400 mμ.
1. Isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane). Use 240
milliliters for the above test. Purify, if necessary, by passage through a column of activated silica gel.
2. Benzene. Use 200 milliliters for the above
test. Purify, if necessary, by distillation or
otherwise.
3. Cyclohexane. Use 70 milliliters for the
above test. Purify, if necessary, by distillation, silica gel percolation, or otherwise.
4. Nitromethane. Use 125 milliliters for the
above test. Purify, if necessary, by distillation or otherwise.
5. n-Hexadecane. Determine the absorbance
on this solvent directly. Purify, if necessary,
by silica gel percolation or otherwise.
B. Other materials—1. Pyrene standard reference. Pyrene, reagent grade, melting point
range 150–152 °C. (Organic Chemical 3627,
Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, N.Y., or
equivalent). The standard reference absorbance is the absorbance at 334 millimicrons of
a standard reference solution of pyrene containing a concentration of 1.0 milligram per
liter in purified isooctane measured against
isooctane of the same spectral purity in 1.0centimeter cells. (This absorbance will be approximately 0.28.)
2. Chrysene solution. Prepare a solution at a
concentration of 5.0 milligrams per liter by
dissolving 5.0 milligrams of chrysene in purified isooctane in a 1-liter volumetric flask.
Adjust to volume with isooctane.
3. Nitrogen gas. Water pumped or equivalent
purity, cylinder with regulator, and valve
control flow at 5 p.s.i.
4. Silica gel. 100–200 mesh (Davison Chemical, Baltimore, Md., Grade 923, or equivalent), purified and activated by the following
procedure: Place about 1 kilogram of silica
gel in a large column and wash with contaminant-free benzene until a 200-milliliter
sample of the benzene coming off the column
will pass the ultraviolet absorption test for
benzene. This test is performed as stipulated
under ‘‘Organic solvents’’ in A under III
above. When the silica gel has been sufficiently cleaned, activate the gel before use
by placing the 1-kilogram batch in a shallow
container in a layer no greater than 1 inch in
depth and heating in an oven (Caution! Explosion Hazard) at 130 °C. for 16 hours, and
store in a vacuum desiccator. Reheating
about once a week is necessary if the silica
gel is repeatedly removed from the desiccator.
5. Aluminum oxide (Aluminum Co. of America,
Grade F-20, or equivalent grade). 80–200 mesh,
purified and activated by the following procedure: Place about 1 kilogram of aluminum

oxide in a large column and wash with contaminant-free benzene until a 200-milliliter
sample of the benzene coming off the column
will pass the ultraviolet absorption test for
benzene. This test is performed as stipulated
under ‘‘Organic solvents’’ in A under III
above. (Caution! Remove Benzene From Adsorbent Under Vacuum To Minimize Explosion Hazard in Subsequent Heating!) When
the aluminum oxide has been sufficiently
cleaned and freed of solvent, activate it before use by placing the 1-kilogram batch in a
shallow container in a layer no greater than
1 inch in depth. Heat in an oven at 130 °C for
16 hours. Upon removal from heat, store at
atmospheric pressure over 80 percent (by
weight) sulfuric acid in a desiccator for at
least 36 hours before use. This gives aluminum oxide with between 6 to 9.5 percent
volatiles. This is determined by heating a
weighed sample of the prepared aluminum
oxide at 2,000 °F for 2 hours and then quickly
reweighing. To insure the proper adsorptive
properties of the aluminum oxide, perform
the following test:
a. Weigh 50 grams ±1 gram of the activated
aluminum oxide and pack into the
chromatographic column (1.3 centimeters ×
75 centimeters) described under ‘‘Apparatus’’
in C under I above. Use glass wool at the column exit to prevent the aluminum oxide
from passing through the column.
b. Place a 250-milliliter graduated cylinder
under the column to measure the amount of
eluate coming from the column.
c. Prewet the aluminum oxide by passing
40 milliliters of isooctane through the column. Adjust the nitrogen pressure so that
the rate of descent of the isooctane coming
off the column is between 1.5 to 2.5 milliliters per minute.
d. Just prior to the last of the isooctane
reaching the top of the aluminum oxide bed,
add 10 milliliters of the isooctane solution
containing 5.0 milligrams of chrysene per
liter.
e. Continue percolation until the isooctane
is just above the aluminum oxide. Then add
200 milliliters of a mixture of benzene and
isooctane (331⁄3 percent benzene and 662⁄3 percent isooctane by volume) to the reservoir
and continue percolation.
f. Continue percolation, collecting the
eluates (40 milliliters of the prewet solution,
10 milliliters of the sample solution, and 200
milliliters of the gradient solution) in the
250-milliliter graduated cylinder until the
level of the gradient solution is just above
the aluminum oxide. Add 200 milliliters of
the eluting solution of benzene and isooctane
(90 percent benzene and 10 percent isooctane
by volume) to the column and continue collecting until a total of 250 milliliters of solution has been obtained. This may be discarded. Now begin to collect the final eluate.
g. Place a 100-milliliter graduated cylinder
under the column and continue the percola-

tion until a 100-milliliter eluate has been obtained.
h. Measure the amount of chrysene in this
100-milliliter fraction by ultraviolet analysis. If the aluminum oxide is satisfactory,
more than 80 percent of the original amount
of chrysene should be found in this fraction.
(NOTE: If the amount of chrysene recovered
is less than 80 percent, the original batch of
aluminum oxide should be sieved between
100–160 mesh. Activation and testing of this
sieved batch should indicate a satisfactory
aluminum oxide for use.)
IV. Sampling. Precautions must be taken to
insure that an uncontaminated sample of the
mineral oil is obtained since ultraviolet absorption is very sensitive to small amounts
of extraneous material contaminating the
sample through careless handling.
V. Procedure. A. Blank. Before proceeding
with the analysis of a sample, determine the
absorbance of the solvent residues by carrying out the procedure without a sample.
B. Sample. 1. Weigh out 20.0 grams ±0.1
gram of the mineral oil into a beaker and
transfer to a 250-milliliter separatory funnel
fitted with a tetrafluoroethylene polymer
stopcock, using enough cyclohexane (25 milliliters) to give a final total volume of 50
milliliters (mineral oil plus cyclohexane).
2. Add 25 milliliters of nitromethane saturated with cyclohexane and shake by hand
vigorously for 3 minutes. Recover the lower
nitromethane layer in a 150-milliliter beaker
containing 1 milliliter of n-hexadecane and
evaporate on the steam bath under nitrogen.
Repeat the extraction four more times, recovering each extract in the 150-milliliter
beaker. Exercise care not to fill the beaker
to such a capacity that solvent losses may
occur.
Evaporate
the
combined
nitromethane extracts to 1 milliliter of nhexadecane
residue
containing
the
nitromethane-soluble mineral oil extractives. (NOTE: Complete removal of the
nitromethane is essential. This can be assured by two successive additions of 5 milliliters of isooctane and reevaporation.)
3. Remove the beaker from the steam bath
and allow to cool.
4. Weigh 50 grams ±1 gram of activated aluminum
oxide
and
pack
into
the
chromatographic column (1.3 centimeters ×
75 centimeters) described under ‘‘Apparatus’’
in C under I above. (NOTE: A small plug of
glass wool is placed at the column exit to
prevent the aluminum oxide from passing
through the column. After adding aluminum
oxide, tap the column lightly to remove air
voids. All percolations using aluminum oxide
are performed under nitrogen pressure. The
500-milliliter reservoir described under ‘‘Apparatus’’ in E under I above is to be used to
hold the elution solvents.)
5. Prewet the column by adding 40 milliliters of isooctane to the column. Adjust nitrogen pressure so that rate of descent of the

isooctane coming off the column is 2.0 to 3.0
milliliters per minute. Be careful to maintain the level of solvent in the reservoir to
prevent air from entering the aluminum
oxide bed. New or additional solvent is added
just before the last portion of the previous
solvent enters the bed. To minimize possible
photo-oxidation effects, the following procedures (steps 6 through 18) shall be carried out
in subdued light.
6. Before the last of the isooctane reaches
the top of the aluminum oxide bed, release
the nitrogen pressure and turn off the stopcock on the column. Transfer the n-hexadecane residue from the 150-milliliter beaker
from procedure step 3 above onto the column, using several washes of isooctane (total
volume of washes should be no greater than
10–15 milliliters).
7. Open the stopcock and continue percolation until the isooctane is about 1 centimeter above the top of the aluminum oxide
bed. Add 200 milliliters of isooctane to the
reservoir, and continue the percolation at
the specified rate.
8. Just before the isooctane surface reaches
the top of the aluminum oxide bed, add 200
milliliters of a mixture of benzene and isooctane (331⁄3 percent benzene and 662⁄3 percent
isooctane by volume) to the reservoir, and
continue the percolation.
9. Just before the surface of this mixture
reaches the top of the aluminum oxide bed,
release the nitrogen pressure, turn off the
stopcock, and discard all the elution solvents
collected up to this point.
10. Add to the reservoir 300 milliliters of a
mixture of benzene and isooctane (90 percent
benzene and 10 percent isooctane by volume),
place a 25-milliliter graduated cylinder
under the column, continue the percolation
until 20 milliliters of eluate has been collected, and then discard the eluate.
11. At this point, place a clean 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask under the column.
Continue the percolation and collect all the
remaining eluate.
(NOTE: Allow the column to drain completely. An increase in the nitrogen pressure
may be necessary as the last of the solvent
comes off the column.)
12. Place 1 milliliter of n-hexadecane into a
150-milliliter beaker. Place this onto a steam
bath under a nitrogen stream and transfer in
small portions the eluate from step 11 above.
Wash out the Erlenmeyer flask with small
amounts of benzene and transfer to the evaporation beaker. Evaporate until only 1 milliliter of hexadecane residue remains. (NOTE:
Complete removal of the benzene is essential. This can be assured by two successive
additions of 5 milliliters of isooctane and reevaporation.)
13. Remove the beaker from the steam bath
and cool.
14. Place a sample of 113.5 grams activated
100- 200-mesh silica gel in a 500-milliliter

glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flask. Add to the
silica gel 46.2 grams (41 milliliters) of
nitromethane. Stopper and shake the flask
vigorously until no lumps of silica gel are
observed and then shake occasionally during
a period of 1 hour. The resultant
nitromethane-treated silica gel is 29 weightpercent nitro-methane and 71 weight-percent
silica gel.
15. Place a small plug of glass wool in the
tapered end of the 1.7 centimeters outside diameter × 115 centimeters column, described
under ‘‘Apparatus’’ in D of I above, adjacent
to the stopcock to prevent silica gel from
passing through the stopcock. Pack the
nitromethane-treated silica gel into the column, tapping lightly. The resultant silica gel
bed should be about 95 centimeters in depth.
Place into a flask 170 milliliters of isooctane
saturated with nitromethane.
16. Place a 100-milliliter graduated cylinder under the column and transfer the residue from the beaker in procedure step 13
above with several washes of the 170 milliliters
of
isooctane,
saturated
with
nitromethane, onto the top of the column.
(Total volume of washes should be no greater
than 10 to 15 milliliters.) Permit isooctane
solution to enter the silica gel bed until the
liquid level is at the top bed level. Place the
remaining amount of the 170 milliliters of
isooctane, saturated with nitromethane, in
the reservoir above the bed for percolation
through the silica gel. Apply nitrogen pressure to the top of the column, adjusting the
pressure so that the isooctane is collected at
the rate of 2.5 to 3.5 milliliters per minute,
and percolate isooctane through the bed
until a quantity of 75.0 milliliters of eluate is
collected. Discard the 75 milliliters of eluate.
Turn off the stopcock and add 250 milliliters
of benzene to the reservoir above the bed.
Use a 400-milliliter beaker to collect the remaining eluate.
17. Open the stopcock, renew the pressure,
and percolate the remaining isooctane and
benzene through the column eluting the remaining aromatics. Transfer the eluate in
small portions from the 400 milliliter beaker
to a 150-milliliter beaker containing 1 milliliter of n-hexadecane and evaporate on the
steam bath under nitrogen. Rinse the 400milliliter beaker well with small portions of
isooctane to obtain a complete transfer.
Complete
removal
of
the
(NOTE:
nitromethane and benzene is essential. This
can be assured by successive additions of 5
milliliters of isooctane and reevaporation.)
18. Transfer the residue with several washes of isooctane into a 200-milliliter volumetric flask. Add isooctane to mark.
19. Record the spectrum of the sample solution in a 1-centimeter cell compared to isooctane from 270 to 400 mμ. After making necessary corrections in the spectrum for cell
differences and for the blank absorbance,
record the maximum absorbance in each of

ANALYTICAL METHOD
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

Because of the sensitivity of the test, the
possibility of errors arising from contamination is great. It is of the greatest importance
that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to
remove all organic matter such as oil,
grease, detergent residues, etc. Examine all
glassware, including stoppers and stopcocks,
under ultraviolet light to detect any residual
fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is
to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care
to avoid contamination of wax samples in
handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate
packaging is essential. Because some of the
polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test

Isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane). Use 180
milliliters for the test described in the preceding paragraph. Purify, if necessary, by
passage through a column of activated silica
gel (Grade 12, Davison Chemical Co., Baltimore, Md., or equivalent) about 90 centimeters in length and 5 centimeters to 8 centimeters in diameter.
Benzene, A.C.S. reagent grade. Use 150 milliliters for the test. Purify, if necessary, by
distillation or otherwise.
n-Hexadecane, 99 percent olefin-free. Dilute
1.0 milliliter of n-hexadecane to 25 milliliters
with isooctane and determine the absorbance
in a 1-centimeter cell compared to isooctane
as reference point between 280 mμ-400 mμ.
The absorbance per centimeter pathlength
shall not exceed 0.00 in this range. If necessary, purify by filtering through a column
containing 100 grams of aluminum oxide (use
same grade as described below) in the lower
half and 100 grams of activated silica gel in
the upper half keeping the column at 150 °C.,
for a period of 15 hours or overnight. The
first 100 milliliters of eluate are used. Purification can also be accomplished by distillation.
Dimethyl sulfoxide. Pure grade, clear,
water-white, m.p. 18° minimum. Dilute 120
milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide with 240
milliliters of distilled water in a 500-milliliter separatory funnel, mix and allow to
cool for 5–10 minutes. Add 40 milliliters of
isooctane to the solution and extract by
shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes.
Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second 500-milliliter separatory funnel and repeat the extraction with 40 milliliters of isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous
layer. Wash each of the 40-milliliter extractives three times with 50-milliliter portions
of distilled water. Shaking time for each
wash is 1 minute. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extractive through anhydrous sodium sulfate prewashed with isooctane (see Sodium sulfate under ‘‘Reagents
and materials’’ for preparation of filter), into
a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask, or optionally into the evaporating flask. Wash the
first separatory funnel with the second 40milliliter isooctane extractive, and pass
through the sodium sulfate into the flask.
Then wash the second and first separatory
funnels successively with a 10-milliliter portion of isooctane, and pass the solvent
through the sodium sulfate into the flask.
Add 1 milliliter of n-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under

nitrogen. Discontinue evaporation when not
over 1 milliliter of residue remains. To the
residue, add a 10-milliliter portion of isooctane and reevaporate to 1 milliliter of
hexadecane. Again, add 10 milliliters of isooctane to the residue and evaporate to 1 milliliter of hexadecane to insure complete removal of all volatile materials. Dissolve the
1 milliliter of hexadecane in isooctane and
make to 25-milliliter volume. Determine the
absorbance in 1-centimeter pathlength cells
compared to isooctane as reference. The absorbance of the solution should not exceed
0.02 per centimeter pathlength in the 280 mμ400 mμ range. (NOTE: Difficulty in meeting
this absorbance specification may be due to
organic impurities in the distilled water.
Repetition of the test omitting the dimethyl
sulfoxide will disclose their presence. If necessary to meet the specification, purify the
water by redistillation, passage through an
ion-exchange resin, or otherwise.)
Purify, if necessary, by the following procedure: To 1,500 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 2-liter glass-stoppered flask, add
6.0 milliliters of phosphoric acid and 50
grams of Norit A (decolorizing carbon, alkaline) or equivalent. Stopper the flask, and
with the use of a magnetic stirrer (tetrafluoroethylene polymer coated bar) stir the
solvent for 15 minutes. Filter the dimethyl
sulfoxide through four thicknesses of fluted
paper (18.5 centimeters, Schleicher &
Schuell, No. 597, or equivalent). If the initial
filtrate contains carbon fines, refilter
through the same filter until a clear filtrate
is obtained. Protect the sulfoxide from air
and moisture during this operation by covering the solvent in the funnel and collection
flask with a layer of isooctane. Transfer the
filtrate to a 2-liter separatory funnel and
draw off the dimethyl sulfoxide into the 2liter distillation flask of the vacuum distillation assembly and distill at approximately 3-millimeter Hg pressure or less. Discard the first 200-milliliter fraction of the
distillate and replace the distillate collection flask with a clean one. Continue the distillation until approximately 1 liter of the
sulfoxide has been collected.
At completion of the distillation, the reagent should be stored in glass-stoppered bottles since it is very hygroscopic and will
react with some metal containers in the
presence of air.
Phosphoric acid. 85 percent A.C.S. reagent
grade.
Aluminum oxide (80–200 mesh Woelm neutral
activity grade 1 [Brockmann], Alupharm Chemicals, New Orleans, La., or equivalent). Pipette
1 milliliter of distilled water into a dry 250milliliter Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a
ground-glass stopper. Stopper the flask and
rotate it in such a manner as to completely
wet out the inside surfaces. When this has
been done add 180 grams of the aluminum
oxide and shake until no lumps or wet spots

for a period of 2 hours. At the end of this
time the water should be evenly distributed
throughout the aluminum oxide powder, and
it should have the same free flowing properties as the original material (flow velocity
with water 0.2 milliliter per minute). At this

PROCEDURE

Before proceeding with analysis of a sample, determine the absorbance in a 1-centimeter path cell between 250 mμ and 400 mμ
for the reagent blank by carrying out the
procedure, without a wax sample, at room
temperature, recording the spectrum after
the complete procedure as prescribed. The
absorbance per centimeter pathlength following the complete procedure should not
exceed 0.04 in the wavelength range from 280
mμ to 299 mμ, inclusive, nor 0.02 in the wavelength range from 300 mμ to 400 mμ. If in either spectrum the characteristic benzene
peaks in the 250 mμ-260 mμ region are
present, remove the benzene by the procedure under ‘‘Organic solvents’’ and record
absorbance again. Place 300 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 1-liter separatory funnel and add 75 milliliters of phosphoric acid.
Mix the contents of the funnel and allow to
stand for 10 minutes. (The reaction between
the sulfoxide and the acid is exothermic. Release pressure after mixing, then keep funnel
stoppered.) Add 150 milliliters of isooctane
and shake to preequilibrate the solvents.
Draw off the individual layers and store in
glass-stoppered flasks.
In a 1-liter separatory funnel place a representative 25-gram sample of wax, add 50
milliliters of isooctane, heat gently, stir
until the wax is in solution; add 100 milliliters of preequilibrated sulfoxide-phosphoric
acid mixture and shake, making sure it remains in solution. If the wax comes out of
solution during these operations, let the
stoppered funnel remain in the jacket until

the wax redissolves. (Remove stopper from
the funnel at intervals to release pressure.)
When the wax is in solution, remove the funnel from the jacket and shake it vigorously
for 2 minutes. Set up three 250-milliliter
separatory funnels with each containing 30
milliliters of preequilibrated isooctane.
After separation of the liquid phases, allow
to cool until the main portion of the wax-isooctane solution begins to show a precipitate.
Gently swirl the funnel when precipitation
first occurs on the inside surface of the funnel to accelerate this process. Carefully draw
off the lower layer, filter it slowly through a
thin layer of glass wool fitted loosely in a filter funnel into the first 250-milliliter separatory funnel, and wash in tandem with the
30-milliliter portions of isooctane contained
in the 250-milliliter separatory funnels.
Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Repeat the extraction operation with two additional portions of the sulfoxide-acid mixture,
replacing the funnel in the jacket after each
extraction to keep the wax in solution and
washing each extractive in tandem through
the same three portions of isooctane.
Collect the successive extractives (300 milliliters total) in a separatory funnel (preferably 2-liter), containing 480 milliliters of
distilled water, mix, and allow to cool for a
few minutes after the last extractive has
been added. Add 80 milliliters of isooctane to
the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Draw off the
lower aqueous layer into a second separatory
funnel (preferably 2-liter) and repeat the extraction with 80 milliliters of isooctane.
Draw off and discard the aqueous layer.
Wash each of the 80-milliliter extractives
three times with 100-milliliter portions of
distilled water. Shaking time for each wash
is 1 minute. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extractive through anhydrous
sodium sulfate prewashed with isooctane (see
Sodium sulfate under ‘‘Reagents and Materials’’ for preparation of filter) into a 250milliliter Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally
into the evaporation flask). Wash the first
separatory funnel with the second 80-milliliter isooctane extractive and pass through
the sodium sulfate. Then wash the second
and first separatory funnels successively
with a 20-milliliter portion of isooctane and
pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate
into the flask. Add 1 milliliter of n-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane using an
aspirator vacuum under nitrogen and in an
oil bath temperature of approximately 90 °C.
Discontinue evaporation when not over 1
milliliter of residue remains. To the residue,
add a 10-milliliter portion of isooctane, reevaporate to 1 milliliter of hexadecane, and
repeat this operation once.
Reserve the residue for column chromatography on the aluminum oxide. Fit the

chromatographic tube, then place the tube
with the disc on the suction flask and apply
the vacuum (approximately 135 millimeters
Hg pressure). Weigh out 180 grams of the aluminum oxide and pour the adsorbent mixture
into the chromatographic tube in approximately 30-centimeter layers. After the addition of each layer, level off the top of the adsorbent with a flat glass rod or metal plunger by pressing down firmly until the adsorbent is well packed. Loosen the topmost few
millimeters of each adsorbent layer with the
end of a metal rod before the addition of the
next layer. Continue packing in this manner
until all the 180 grams of the adsorbent is
added to the tube. Level off the top of the adsorbent by pressing down firmly with a flat
glass rod or metal plunger to make the depth
of the adsorbent bed approximately 80 centimeters in depth. Turn off the vacuum and remove the suction flask. Dissolve the hexadecane residue in 10 milliliters of warm benzene and decant the solution onto the column and allow the liquid level to recede to
barely above the adsorbent level. Rapidly
complete the transfer similarly with two 10milliliter portions of benzene swirling the
flask repeatedly each time to assure adequate washing of the residue. Fix the 1,000milliliter reservoir onto the top of the
chromatographic column. Just before the
final 10-milliliter wash reaches the top of the
adsorbent, add 670 milliliters of benzene to
the reservoir and continue the percolation at
the 2–3 milliliter per minute rate until a
total of 670 milliliters of benzene has been
utilized. Collect the eluate in a clean 1-liter
Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into a 1-liter
evaporation flask). Allow the column to
drain until most of the solvent mixture is removed. Add 1 milliliter of n-hexadecane and
completely remove the benzene by evaporation under nitrogen, using the special procedure to eliminate benzene as previously
described under ‘‘Organic Solvents.’’ Quantitatively transfer the residue with isooctane
to a 25-milliliter volumetric flask and adjust
to volume. Determine the absorbance of the
solution in the 1-centimeter pathlength cells
compared to isooctane as reference between
250 mμ-400 mμ. Correct for any absorbance
derived from the reagents as determined by
carrying out the procedure without a wax
sample. If either spectrum shows the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250 mμ-260 mμ
region, evaporate the solution to remove
benzene by the procedure under ‘‘Organic
Solvents.’’ Dissolve the residue, transfer
quantitatively, and adjust to volume in isooctane in a 25-milliliter volumetric flask.
Record the absorbance again. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits
prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section,
the wax meets the ultraviolet absorbance
specifications.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

Because of the sensitivity of the test, the
possibility of errors arising from contamination is great. It is of the greatest importance
that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to
remove all organic matter such as oil,
grease, detergent, residues, etc. Examine all
glassware including stoppers and stopcocks,

under ultraviolet light to detect any residual
fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is
to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care
to avoid contamination of oil samples in
handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate
packaging is essential. Because some of the
polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test
are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the
entire procedure is to be carried out under
subdued light.
APPARATUS

Separatory funnels. 250-milliliter, 500-milliliter, 1,000-milliliter, and preferably 2,000milliliter capacity, equipped with tetrafluoroethylene polymer stopcocks.
Evaporation flask (optional). 250-milliliter or
500-milliliter
capacity
all-glass
flask
equipped with standard-taper stopper having
inlet and outlet tubes to permit passage of
nitrogen across the surface of contained liquid to be evaporated.
Spectrophotometric cells. Fused quartz cells,
optical path length in the range of 5,000 centimeters ±0.005 centimeter; also for checking
spectrophotometer performance only, optical
path length in the range 1.000 centimeter
±0.005 centimeter. With distilled water in the
cells, determine any absorbance differences.
Spectrophotometer.
Special
range
250
millicrons-400 millimicrons with spectral slit
width of 2 millimicrons or less; under instrument operating conditions for these absorbance measurements, the spectrophotometer

requirements:
Absorbance repeatability, ±0.01 at 0.4 absorbance.
Absorbance accuracy, 1 ±0.05 at 0.4 absorbance.
Wavelength
repeatability,
±0.2

§ 178.3910

Soxhlet apparatus. 60-millimeter diameter
body tubes fitted with condenser and 500-milliliter round-bottom boiling flask. A supply
of paper thimbles to fit is required.
Nitrogen cylinder. Water-pumped or equivalent purity nitrogen in cylinder equipped
with regulator and valve to control flow at 5
p.s.i.g.
REAGENTS AND MATERIALS

Organic solvents. All solvents used throughout the procedure shall meet the specifications and tests described in this specification. The isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane)
shall pass the following test:
Place 180 milliliters of solvent in a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask, add 1 milliliter of
purified n-hexadecane and evaporate on the
steam bath under a stream of nitrogen (a
loose aluminum foil jacket around the flask
will speed evaporation). Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 milliliter of residue
remains.
Alternatively, the evaporation time can be
reduced by using the optional evaporation
flask. In this case the solvent and n-hexadecane are placed in the flask on the steam
bath, the tube assembly is inserted, and a
stream of nitrogen is fed through the inlet
tube while the outlet tube is connected to a
solvent trap and vacuum line in such a way
as to prevent any flow-back of condensate
into the flask.
Dissolve the 1 milliliter of hexadecane residue in isooctane and make to 25 milliliters
volume. Determine the absorbance in the 5centimeter path length cells compared to
isooctane as reference. The absorbance of the
solution of the solvent residue shall not exceed 0.01 per centimeter path length between
280 and 400 mμ. Purify, if necessary, by passage through a column of activated silica gel
(Grade 12, Davison Chemical Co., Baltimore,
Maryland, or equivalent) about 90 centimeters in length and 5 centimeters to 8 centimeters in diameter.
n-Hexadecane, 99-percent olefin-free. Dilute
1.0 milliliter of n-hexadecane to 25 milliliters
with isooctane and determine the absorbance
in a 5-centimeter cell compared to isooctane
as reference point between 280 mμ-400 mμ.
The absorbance per centimeter path length
shall not exceed 0.00 in this range. Purify, if
necessary, by percolation through activated
silica gel or by distillation.
Dimethyl
sulfoxide.
Spectrophotometric
grade (Crown Zellerbach Corp., Camas,
Washington, or equivalent). Absorbance (1centimeter cell, distilled water reference,
sample completely saturated with nitrogen).

There shall be no irregularities in the absorbance curve within these wavelengths.
Phosphoric acid. 85 percent A.C.S. reagent
grade.
Sodium sulfate, anhydrous, A.C.S. reagent
grade, preferably in granular form. For each
bottle of sodium sulfate reagent used, establish as follows the necessary sodium sulfate
prewash to provide such filters required in
the method: Place approximately 35 grams of
anhydrous sodium sulfate in a 30-milliliter
coarse, fritted-glass funnel or in a 65-milliliter filter funnel with glass wool plug; wash
with successive 15-milliliter portions of the
indicated solvent until a 15-milliliter portion
of the wash shows 0.00 absorbance per centimeter path length between 280 mμ and 400 mμ
when tested as prescribed under ‘‘Organic
solvents.’’ Usually three portions of wash
solvent are sufficient.
Before proceeding with analysis of a sample, determine the absorbance in a 5-centimeter path cell between 250 millimicrons and
400 millimicrons for the reagent blank by
carrying out the procedure, without a metal
sample. The absorbance per centimeter path
length should not exceed 0.02 in the wavelength range from 280 mμ to 400 mμ.
Place 300 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide
in a 1-liter separatory funnel and add 75 milliliters of phosphoric acid. Mix the contents
of the funnel and allow to stand for 10 minutes. (The reaction between the sulfoxide
and the acid is exothermic. Release pressure
after mixing, then keep funnel stoppered.)
Add 150 milliliters of isooctane and shake to
pre-equilibrate the solvents. Draw off the individual layers and store in glass-stoppered
flasks.
PROCEDURE

Sample. Select metal foil or sheet stock for
the test which has not been previously contaminated by careless handling or exposure
to atmospheric dust and fumes. A commercial coil in the form supplied for spindle
mounting in a packaging line or wrapping
machine is most suitable. Strip off the outside turn of metal and discard. Carefully
avoid contamination or damage from handling the metal (wear gloves). Remove a 16–
18-foot length from the coil and place it on a
flat surface protected by a length of new
kraft paper. Cut four 15-foot strips from the
sample, each 3 inches wide (avoid tearing the
edges of the strips). Using a piece of suitable
glass rod, roll the strips of metal into loose
coils and insert each into a Soxhlet thimble.
Each turn of coil should be visibly separated
from the adjacent turn.

Extraction. Fill each of the four Soxhlet
tubes with purified isooctane (see under
heading ‘‘Reagents and Materials,’’ above)
until siphon action occurs and then refill the
tube body. Supply heat to the boiling flask
and allow extraction to continue for at least
8 hours or until repeated weighings of the
dried and cooled coil show no further weight
loss.
Combine the isooctane extracts from the
four Soxhlet units in a suitable beaker, rinsing each tube and flask into the beaker with
fresh purified solvent. Evaporate the solvent
under an atmosphere of inert gas (nitrogen)
to residual volume of 50–60 milliliters and
transfer this solution to a 500-milliliter separatory funnel containing 100 milliliters of
pre-equilibrated sulfoxide-phosphoric acid
mixture. Complete the transfer of the sample
with small portions of pre-equilibrated isooctane to give a total volume of the residue
and solvent of 75 milliliters. Shake the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Set up three
250-milliliter separatory funnels with each
containing 30 milliliters of pre-equilibrated
isooctane. After separation of liquid phases,
carefully draw off lower layer into the first
250-milliliter separatory funnel and wash in
tandem with the 30-milliliter portion of isooctane contained in the 250-milliliter separatory funnels. Shaking time for each wash
is 1 minute. Repeat the extraction operation
with two additional portions of the sulfoxide-acid mixture and wash each extractive
in tandem through the same three portions
of isooctane.
Collect the successive extractives (300 milliliters total) in a separatory funnel (preferably 2-liter) containing 480 milliliters of
distilled water; mix, and allow to cool for a
few minutes after the last extractive has
been added. Add 80 milliliters of isooctane to
the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Draw off the
lower aqueous layer into a second separatory
funnel (preferably 2-liter) and repeat the extraction with 80 milliliter of isooctane. Draw
off and discard the aqueous layer. Wash each
of the 80 milliliter extractives three times
with 100-milliliter portions distilled water.

§ 179.25 General provisions for food irradiation.
For the purposes of § 179.26, current
good manufacturing practice is defined
to include the following restrictions:
(a) Any firm that treats foods with
ionizing radiation shall comply with
the requirements of part 110 of this
chapter and other applicable regulations.
(b) Food treated with ionizing radiation shall receive the minimum radiation dose reasonably required to accomplish its intended technical effect
and not more than the maximum dose
specified by the applicable regulation
for that use.
(c) Packaging materials subjected to
irradiation incidental to the radiation
treatment and processing of prepackaged food shall be in compliance
with § 179.45, shall be the subject of an
exemption for such use under § 170.39 of
this chapter, or shall be the subject of
an effective premarket notification for

a food contact substance for such use
submitted under § 170.100 of this chapter.
(d) Radiation treatment of food shall
conform to a scheduled process. A
scheduled process for food irradiation
is a written procedure that ensures
that the radiation dose range selected
by the food irradiation processor is
adequate under commercial processing
conditions (including atmosphere and
temperature) for the radiation to
achieve its intended effect on a specific
product and in a specific facility. A
food irradiation processor shall operate
with a scheduled process established by
qualified persons having expert knowledge in radiation processing requirements of food and specific for that food
and for that irradiation processor’s
treatment facility.
(e) A food irradiation processor shall
maintain records as specified in this
section for a period of time that exceeds the shelf life of the irradiated
food product by 1 year, up to a maximum of 3 years, whichever period is
shorter, and shall make these records
available for inspection and copy by
authorized employees of the Food and
Drug Administration. Such records
shall include the food treated, lot identification, scheduled process, evidence
of compliance with the scheduled process, ionizing energy source, source calibration, dosimetry, dose distribution in
the product, and the date of irradiation.

Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 180.1 General.
(a) Substances having a history of
use in food for human consumption or
in food contact surfaces may at any
time have their safety or functionality
brought into question by new information that in itself is not conclusive. An
interim food additive regulation for
the use of any such substance may be
promulgated in this subpart when new
information raises a substantial question about the safety or functionality
of the substance but there is a reasonable certainty that the substance is
not harmful and that no harm to the
public health will result from the continued use of the substance for a limited period of time while the question
raised is being resolved by further
study.
(b) No interim food additive regulation may be promulgated if the new information is conclusive with respect to
the question raised or if there is a reasonable likelihood that the substance
is harmful or that continued use of the
substance will result in harm to the
public health.
(c) The Commissioner, on his own initiative or on the petition of any interested person, pursuant to part 10 of this
chapter, may propose an interim food
additive regulation. A final order promulgating an interim food additive
regulation shall provide that continued
use of the substance in food is subject
to each of the following conditions:
(1) Use of the substance in food or
food contact surfaces must comply
with whatever limitations the Commissioner deems to be appropriate under
the circumstances.
(2) Within 60 days following the effective date of the regulation, an interested person shall satisfy the Commissioner in writing that studies adequate
and appropriate to resolve the questions raised about the substance have

been undertaken, or the Food and Drug
Administration may undertake the
studies. The Commissioner may extend
this 60-day period if necessary to review and act on proposed protocols. If
no such commitment is made, or adequate and appropriate studies are not
undertaken, an order shall immediately be published in the FEDERAL
REGISTER revoking the interim food additive regulation effective upon publication.
(3) A progress report shall be filed on
the studies every January 1 and July 1
until completion. If the progress report
is inadequate or if the Commissioner
concludes that the studies are not
being pursued promptly and diligently
or if interim results indicate a reasonable likelihood that a health hazard exists, an order will promptly be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER revoking the interim food additive regulation effective upon publication.
(4) If nonclinical laboratory studies
are involved, studies filed with the
Commissioner shall include, with respect to each study, either a statement
that the study has been or will be conducted in compliance with the good
laboratory practice regulations as set
forth in part 58 of this chapter, or, if
any such study was not conducted in
compliance with such regulations, a
brief statement of the reason for the
noncompliance.
(5) [Reserved]
(6) If clinical investigations involving
human subjects are involved, such investigations filed with the Commissioner shall include, with respect to
each investigation, a statement that
the investigation either was conducted
in compliance with the requirements
for institutional review set forth in
part 56 of this chapter, or was not subject to such requirements in accordance with §§ 56.104 or 56.105, and that it
has been or will be conducted in compliance with the requirements for informed consent set forth in part 50 of
this chapter.
(d) Promptly upon completion of the
studies undertaken on the substance,
the Commissioner will review all available data, will terminate the interim
food additive regulation, and will either issue a food additive regulation or

will require elimination of the substance from the food supply.
(e) The Commissioner may consult
with advisory committees, professional
organizations, or other experts in the
field, in evaluating:
(1) Whether an interim food additive
regulation is justified,
(2) The type of studies necessary and
appropriate to resolve questions raised
about a substance,
(3) Whether interim results indicate
the reasonable likelihood that a health
hazard exists, or
(4) Whether the data available at the
conclusion of those studies justify a
food additive regulation.
(f) Where appropriate, an emergency
action level may be issued for a substance subject to paragraph (a) of this
section that is not an approved food additive, pending the issuance of a final
interim food additive regulation. Such
an action level shall be issued pursuant
to sections 306 and 402(a) of the act to
identify, based upon available data, a
safe level of use for the substance.
Such an action level shall be issued in
a notice published in the FEDERAL REGISTER and shall be followed as soon as
practicable by a proposed interim food
additive regulation. Where the available data do not permit establishing an
action level for the safe use of a substance, use of the substance may be
prohibited. The identification of a prohibited substance may be made in part
189 of this chapter when appropriate.

Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 181.1 General.
(a) An ingredient whose use in food
or food packaging is subject to a prior
sanction or approval within the meaning of section 201(s)(4) of the Act is exempt from classification as a food additive. The Commissioner will publish in
this part all known prior sanctions.
Any interested person may submit to
the Commissioner a request for publication of a prior sanction, supported by
evidence to show that it falls within
section 201(s)(4) of the Act.
(b) Based upon scientific data or information that shows that use of a
prior-sanctioned food ingredient may
be injurious to health, and thus in violation of section 402 of the Act, the
Commissioner will establish or amend
an applicable prior sanction regulation
to impose whatever limitations or conditions are necessary for the safe use of
the ingredient, or to prohibit use of the
ingredient.
(c) Where appropriate, an emergency
action level may be issued for a priorsanctioned substance, pending the
issuance of a final regulation in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Such an action level shall be
issued pursuant to section 402(a) of the
Act to identify, based upon available
data, conditions of use of the substance
that may be injurious to health. Such
an action level shall be issued in a notice published in the FEDERAL REG-

ISTER and shall be followed as soon as
practicable by a proposed regulation in
accordance with paragraph (b) of this
section. Where the available data demonstrate that the substance may be injurious at any level, use of the substance may be prohibited. The identification of a prohibited substance may
be made in part 189 of this chapter
when appropriate.

FR 52821, Sept. 30, 1977; 54 FR 39635, Sept. 27,
1989]

§ 181.5

Prior sanctions.

(a) A prior sanction shall exist only
for a specific use(s) of a substance in
food, i.e., the level(s), condition(s),
product(s), etc., for which there was explicit approval by the Food and Drug
Administration or the United States
Department of Agriculture prior to
September 6, 1958.
(b) The existence of a prior sanction
exempts the sanctioned use(s) from the
food additive provisions of the Act but
not from the other adulteration or the
misbranding provisions of the Act.
(c) All known prior sanctions shall be
the subject of a regulation published in
this part. Any such regulation is subject to amendment to impose whatever
limitation(s) or condition(s) may be
necessary for the safe use of the ingredient, or revocation to prohibit use of
the ingredient, in order to prevent the
adulteration of food in violation of section 402 of the Act.
(d) In proposing, after a general evaluation of use of an ingredient, regulations affirming the GRAS status of
substances added directly to human
food in part 184 of this chapter or substances in food-contact surfaces in part
186 of this chapter, or establishing a
food additive regulation for substances
added directly to human food in parts
172 and 173 of this chapter or food additives in food-contact surfaces in parts
174, 175, 176, 177, 178 and § 179.45 of this
chapter, the Commissioner shall, if he
is aware of any prior sanction for use
of the ingredient under conditions different from those proposed in the regulation, concurrently propose a separate

§ 181.26

regulation covering such use of the ingredient under this part. If the Commissioner is unaware of any such applicable prior sanction, the proposed regulation will so state and will require any
person who intends to assert or rely on
such sanction to submit proof of its existence. Any food additive or GRAS
regulation promulgated after a general
evaluation of use of an ingredient constitutes a determination that excluded
uses would result in adulteration of the
food in violation of section 402 of the
Act, and the failure of any person to
come forward with proof of such an applicable prior sanction in response to a
proposal will constitute a waiver of the
right to assert or rely on such sanction
at any later time. The notice will also
constitute a proposal to establish a
regulation under this part, incorporating the same provisions, in the
event that such a regulation is determined to be appropriate as a result of
submission of proof of such an applicable prior sanction in response to the
proposal.

Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 182.1 Substances that are generally
recognized as safe.
(a) It is impracticable to list all substances that are generally recognized
as safe for their intended use. However,
by way of illustration, the Commissioner regards such common food ingredients as salt, pepper, vinegar, baking powder, and monosodium glutamate as safe for their intended use.
This part includes additional substances that, when used for the purposes indicated, in accordance with
good manufacturing practice, are regarded by the Commissioner as
generaly recognized as safe for such
uses.
(b) For the purposes of this section,
good manufacturing practice shall be

defined to include the following restrictions:
(1) The quantity of a substance added
to food does not exceed the amount
reasonably required to accomplish its
intended physical, nutritional, or other
technical effect in food; and
(2) The quantity of a substance that
becomes a component of food as a result of its use in the manufacturing,
processing, or packaging of food, and
which is not intended to accomplish
any physical or other technical effect
in the food itself, shall be reduced to
the extent reasonably possible.
(3) The substance is of appropriate
food grade and is prepared and handled
as a food ingredient. Upon request the
Commissioner will offer an opinion,
based on specifications and intended
use, as to whether or not a particular
grade or lot of the substance is of suitable purity for use in food and would
generally be regarded as safe for the
purpose intended, by experts qualified
to evaluate its safety.
(c) The inclusion of substances in the
list of nutrients does not constitute a
finding on the part of the Department
that the substance is useful as a supplement to the diet for humans.
(d) Substances that are generally recognized as safe for their intended use
within the meaning of section 409 of
the act are listed in this part. When
the status of a substance has been reevaluated, it will be deleted from this
part, and will be issued as a new regulation under the appropriate part, e.g.,
‘‘affirmed as GRAS’’ under part 184 or
186 of this chapter; ‘‘food additive regulation’’ under parts 170 through 180 of
this chapter; ‘‘interim food additive
regulation’’ under part 180 of this chapter; or ‘‘prohibited from use in food’’

Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 184.1 Substances added directly to
human food affirmed as generally
recognized as safe (GRAS).
(a) The direct human food ingredients listed in this part have been reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration and determined to be generally
recognized as safe (GRAS) for the purposes and under the conditions prescribed. The regulations in this part
shall sufficiently describe each ingredient to identify the characteristics of
the ingredient that has been affirmed
as GRAS and to differentiate it from
other possible versions of the ingredient that have not been affirmed as
GRAS. Ingredients affirmed as GRAS
in this part are also GRAS as indirect
human food ingredients, subject to any
limitations prescribed in parts 174, 175,
176, 177, 178 or § 179.45 of this chapter or
in part 186 of this chapter. The purity
specifications in this part do not apply
when the ingredient is used in indirect
applications. However, when used in indirect applications, the ingredient
must be of a purity suitable for its intended
use
in
accordance
with
§ 170.30(h)(1) of this chapter.
(b) Any ingredient affirmed as GRAS
in this part shall be used in accordance
with current good manufacturing practice. For the purpose of this part, current good manufacturing practice includes the requirements that a direct
human food ingredient be of appropriate food grade; that it be prepared
and handled as a food ingredient; and
that the quantity of the ingredient
added to food does not exceed the
amount reasonably required to accomplish the intended physical, nutritional, or other technical effect in
food.
(1) If the ingredient is affirmed as
GRAS with no limitations on its conditions of use other than current good
manufacturing practice, it shall be regarded as GRAS if its conditions of use
are consistent with the requirements of
paragraph (b), (c), and (d) of this section. When the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determines that it is
appropriate, the agency will describe
one or more current good manufacturing practice conditions of use in the

21 CFR Ch. I (4–1–12 Edition)

regulation that affirms the GRAS status of the ingredient. For example,
when the safety of an ingredient has
been evaluated on the basis of limited
conditions of use, the agency will describe in the regulation that affirms
the GRAS status of the ingredient, one
or more of these limited conditions of
use, which may include the category of
food(s), the technical effect(s) or functional use(s) of the ingredient, and the
level(s) of use. If the ingredient is used
under conditions that are significantly
different from those described in the
regulation, that use of the ingredient
may not be GRAS. In such a case, a
manufacturer may not rely on the regulation as authorizing that use but
shall independently establish that that
use is GRAS or shall use the ingredient
in accordance with a food additive regulation. Persons seeking FDA approval
of an independent determination that a
use of an ingredient is GRAS may submit a GRAS petition in accordance
with § 170.35 of this chapter.
(2) If the ingredient is affirmed as
GRAS with specific limitation(s), it
shall be used in food only within such
limitation(s), including the category of
food(s), the functional use(s) of the ingredient, and the level(s) of use. Any
use of such an ingredient not in full
compliance with each such established
limitation shall require a food additive
regulation.
(3) If the ingredient is affirmed as
GRAS for a specific use, without a general evaluation of use of the ingredient,
other uses may also be GRAS.
(c) The listing of a food ingredient in
this part does not authorize the use of
such substance in a manner that may
lead to deception of the consumer or to
any other violation of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the
Act).
(d) The listing of more than one ingredient to produce the same technological effect does not authorize use of
a combination of two or more ingredients to accomplish the same technological effect in any one food at a combined level greater than the highest
level permitted for one of the ingredients.
(e) If the Commissioner of Food and
Drugs is aware of any prior sanction
for use of an ingredient under condi-

tions different from those proposed to
be affirmed as GRAS, he will concurrently propose a separate regulation
covering such use of the ingredient
under part 181 of this chapter. If the
Commissioner is unaware of any such
applicable prior sanction, the proposed
regulation will so state and will require any person who intends to assert
or rely on such sanction to submit
proof of its existence. Any regulation
promulgated pursuant to this section
constitutes a determination that excluded uses would result in adulteration of the food in violation of section
402 of the Act, and the failure of any
person to come forward with proof of
such an applicable prior sanction in response to the proposal will constitute a
waiver of the right to assert or rely on
such sanction at any later time. The
notice will also constitute a proposal
to establish a regulation under part 181
of this chapter, incorporating the same
provisions, in the event that such a
regulation is determined to be appropriate as a result of submission of proof
of such an applicable prior sanction in
response to the proposal.
(f) The label and labeling of the ingredient and any intermediate mix of
the ingredient for use in finished food
shall bear, in addition to the other labeling required by the Act:
(1) The name of the ingredient, except where exempted from such labeling in part 101 of this chapter.
(2) A statement of concentration of
the ingredient in any intermediate
mix; or other information to permit a
food processor independently to determine that use of the ingredients will be
in accordance with any limitations and
good manufacturing practice gudelines
prescribed.
(3) Adequate directions for use to
provide a final food product that complies with any limitations prescribed
for the ingredient(s).

§ 184.1685 Rennet
(animal-derived)
and chymosin preparation (fermentation-derived).
(a)(1) Rennet and bovine rennet are
commercial extracts containing the active enzyme rennin (CAS Reg. No. 9001–
98–3), also known as chymosin (International Union of Biochemistry Enzyme
Commission
(E.C.)
3.4.23.4).
Rennet is the aqueous extract prepared
from cleaned, frozen, salted, or dried
fourth stomachs (abomasa) of calves,
kids, or lambs. Bovine rennet is the
product from adults of the animals listed above. Both products are called
rennet and are clear amber to dark
brown liquid preparations or white to
tan powders.
(2) Chymosin preparation is a clear
solution containing the active enzyme
chymosin (E.C. 3.4.23.4). It is derived,
via fermentation, from a nonpathogenic and nontoxigenic strain of Escherichia
coli
K–12
containing
the
prochymosin gene. The prochymosin is
isolated as an insoluble aggregate that
is acid-treated to destroy residual cellular material and, after solubilization,
is acid-treated to form chymosin. It
must be processed with materials that
are generally recognized as safe, or are
food additives that have been approved
by the Food and Drug Administration
for this use.
(3) Chymosin preparation is a clear
solution containing the active enzyme
chymosin (E.C. 3.4.23.4). It is derived,
via fermentation, from a nonpathogenic and nontoxigenic strain of
Kluyveromyces marxianus variety lactis,
containing the prochymosin gene. The
prochymosin is secreted by cells into
fermentation broth and converted to
chymosin by acid treatment. All materials used in the processing and formulating of chymosin must be either generally recognized as safe (GRAS), or be
food additives that have been approved
by the Food and Drug Administration
for this use.

GRAS in this part shall be used in accordance with current good manufacturing practice. For the purpose of this
part, current good manufacturing practice includes the requirements that an
indirect human food ingredient be of a
purity suitable for its intended use,
and that it be used at a level no higher
than reasonably required to achieve its
intended technical effect in the foodcontact article.
(1) If the ingredient is affirmed as
GRAS with no limitations on its conditions of use other than current good
manufacturing practice, it shall be regarded as GRAS if its conditions of use
are consistent with the requirements of
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. When the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determines that it is
appropriate, the agency will describe
one or more current good manufacturing practice conditions of use in the
regulation that affirms the GRAS status of the indirect ingredient. For example, when the safety of an ingredient

has been evaluated on the basis of limited conditions of use, the agency will
describe in the regulation that affirms
the GRAS status of the indirect ingredient, one or more of these limited conditions of use, which may include the
category of food-contact surface(s),
technical effect(s) or functional use(s)
of the indirect ingredient, and the
level(s) of use. If the ingredient is used
under conditions that are significantly
different from those described in the
regulation, such use of a substance
may not be GRAS. In such a case, a
manufacturer may not rely on the regulation as authorizing that use but
shall independently establish that the
use is GRAS or shall use the ingredient
in accordance with a food additive regulation. Persons seeking FDA approval
of an independent determination that a
use of an ingredient is GRAS may submit a GRAS petition in accordance
with § 170.35 of this chapter.
(2) If the ingredient is affirmed as
GRAS with specific limitation(s), it
shall be used in food-contact surfaces
only within such limitation(s), including the category of food-contact surface(s), the functional use(s) of the ingredient, and the level(s) of use. Any
use of such an ingredient not in full
compliance with each such established
limitation shall require a food additive
regulation.
(3) If the ingredient is affirmed as
GRAS for a specific use, prior to general evaluation of use of the ingredient,
other uses may also be GRAS.
(c) The listing of a food ingredient in
this part does not authorize the use of
such substance for the purpose of adding the ingredient to the food through
extraction from the food-contact surface.
(d) The listing of a food ingredient in
this part does not authorize the use of
such substance in a manner that may
lead to deception to the consumer or to
any other violation of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the
Act).
(e) If the Commissioner of Food and
Drugs is aware of any prior sanction
for use of an ingredient under conditions different from those proposed to
be affirmed as GRAS, he will concurrently propose a separate regulation
covering such use of the ingredient

under part 181 of this chapter. If the
Commissioner is unaware of any such
applicable prior sanction, the proposed
regulation will so state and will require any person who intends to assert
or rely on such sanction to submit
proof of its existence. Any regulation
promulgated pursuant to this section
constitutes a determination that excluded uses would result in adulteration of the food in violation of section
402 of the Act, and the failure of any
person to come forward with proof of
such an applicable prior sanction in response to the proposal will constitute a
waiver of the right to assert or rely on
such sanction at any later time. The
notice will also constitute a proposal
to establish a regulation under part 181
of this chapter, incorporating the same
provisions, in the event that such a
regulation is determined to be appropriate as a result of submission of proof
of such an applicable prior sanction in
response to the proposal.

the desired product.
(b) Requirements. (1) No human food
shall be manufactured from, processed
with, or otherwise contain, prohibited
cattle materials.
(2) The small intestine is not considered prohibited cattle material if the
distal ileum is removed by a procedure
that removes at least 80 inches of the
uncoiled and trimmed small intestine,
as measured from the caeco-colic junction and progressing proximally towards the jejunum, or by a procedure
that the establishment can demonstrate is equally effective in ensuring complete removal of the distal
ileum.
(c) Records. (1) Manufacturers and
processors of a human food that is
manufactured from, processed with, or
otherwise contains, material from cattle must establish and maintain
records sufficient to demonstrate that
the food is not manufactured from,
processed with, or does not otherwise
contain, prohibited cattle materials.
(2) Records must be retained for 2
years after the date they were created.
(3) Records must be retained at the
manufacturing or processing establishment or at a reasonably accessible location.
(4) The maintenance of electronic
records
is
acceptable.
Electronic
records are considered to be reasonably
accessible if they are accessible from
an onsite location.
(5) Records required by this section
and existing records relevant to compliance with this section must be available to FDA for inspection and copying.
(6) When filing entry with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the importer of record of a human food manu-

factured from, processed with, or otherwise containing, cattle material
must affirm that the food was manufactured from, processed with, or otherwise contains, cattle material and
must affirm that the food was manufactured in accordance with this section. If a human food is manufactured
from, processed with, or otherwise contains, cattle material, then the importer of record must, if requested, provide within 5 days records sufficient to
demonstrate that the food is not manufactured from, processed with, or does
not otherwise contain, prohibited cattle material.
(7) Records established or maintained
to satisfy the requirements of this subpart that meet the definition of electronic records in § 11.3(b)(6) of this
chapter are exempt from the requirements of part 11 of this chapter.
Records that satisfy the requirements
of this subpart but that are also required under other applicable statutory
provisions or regulations remain subject to part 11 of this chapter.
(d) Adulteration. (1) Failure of a manufacturer or processor to operate in
compliance with the requirements of
paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section
renders human food adulterated under
section 402(a)(4) of the act.
(2) Human food manufactured from,
processed with, or otherwise containing, prohibited cattle materials is
unfit for human food and deemed adulterated under section 402(a)(3) of the
act.
(3) Food additive status. Prohibited
cattle materials for use in human food
are food additives subject to section 409
of the act, except when used as dietary
ingredients in dietary supplements.
The use or intended use of any prohibited cattle material in human food
causes the material and the food to be
adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)
of the act if the prohibited cattle material is a food additive, unless it is the
subject of a food additive regulation or
of an investigational exemption for a
food additive under § 170.17 of this chapter.

for wine bottles.
(a) Tin-coated lead foil is composed
of a lead foil coated on one or both
sides with a thin layer of tin. Tin-coated lead foil has been used as a capsule
(i.e., as a covering applied over the
cork and neck areas) on wine bottles to
prevent insect infestation, as a barrier
to oxygen, and for decorative purposes.
Information received by the Food and
Drug Administration establishes that
the use of such a capsule on wine bottles may reasonably be expected to result in lead becoming a component of
the wine.
(b) The capping of any bottles of wine
after February 8, 1996, with a tin-coated lead foil capsule renders the wine
adulterated and in violation of section
402(a)(2)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act because lead from
the capsule, which is an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section
409 of the act, may reasonably be expected to become a component of the
wine.

Subpart B—New Dietary
Ingredient Notification
§ 190.6 Requirement for premarket notification.
(a) At least 75 days before introducing or delivering for introduction
into interstate commerce a dietary
supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient that has not been
present in the food supply as an article
used for food in a form in which the
food has not been chemically altered,
the manufacturer or distributor of that
supplement, or of the new dietary ingredient, shall submit to the Office of
Nutritional Products, Labeling and Dietary Supplements (HFS–820), Center
for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition,
Food and Drug Administration, 5100
Paint Branch Pkwy., College Park, MD
20740, information including any citation to published articles that is the
basis on which the manufacturer or
distributor has concluded that a dietary supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe. An original and two
copies of this notification shall be submitted.
(b) The notification required by paragraph (a) of this section shall include:
(1) The name and complete address of
the manufacturer or distributor of the
dietary supplement that contains a
new dietary ingredient, or of the new
dietary ingredient;
(2) The name of the new dietary ingredient that is the subject of the premarket notification, including the
Latin binomial name (including the author) of any herb or other botanical;
(3) A description of the dietary supplement or dietary supplements that
contain the new dietary ingredient including:
(i) The level of the new dietary ingredient in the dietary supplement; and
(ii) The conditions of use recommended or suggested in the labeling
of the dietary supplement, or if no conditions of use are recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary
supplement, the ordinary conditions of
use of the supplement;
(4) The history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the
dietary ingredient, when used under
the conditions recommended or sug-

gested in the labeling of the dietary
supplement, will reasonably be expected to be safe, including any citation to published articles or other evidence that is the basis on which the
distributor or manufacturer of the dietary supplement that contains the new
dietary ingredient has concluded that
the new dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe. Any reference to published information offered
in support of the notification shall be
accompanied by reprints or photostatic
copies of such references. If any part of
the material submitted is in a foreign
language, it shall be accompanied by
an accurate and complete English
translation; and
(5) The signature of the person designated by the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary supplement that
contains a new dietary ingredient.
(c) FDA will acknowledge its receipt
of a notification made under section
413 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and will notify the
submitter of the date of receipt of such
a notification. The date that the agency receives the notification submitted
under paragraph (a) of this section is
the filing date for the notification. For
75 days after the filing date, the manufacturer or distributor of a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary
ingredient shall not introduce, or deliver for introduction, into interstate
commerce the dietary supplement that
contains the new dietary ingredient.
(d) If the manufacturer or distributor
of a dietary supplement that contains a
new dietary ingredient, or of the new
dietary ingredient, provides additional
information in support of the new dietary ingredient notification, the agency will review all submissions pertaining to that notification, including
responses made to inquiries from the
agency, to determine whether they are
substantive and whether they require
that the 75-day period be reset. If the
agency determines that the new submission is a substantive amendment,
FDA will assign a new filing date. FDA
will acknowledge receipt of the additional information and, when applicable, notify the manufacturer of the new
filing date, which is the date of receipt
by FDA of the information that constitutes the substantive amendment.

(e) FDA will not disclose the existence of, or the information contained
in, the new dietary ingredient notification for 90 days after the filing date of
the notification. After the 90th day, all
information in the notification will be
placed on public display, except for any
information that is trade secret or otherwise confidential commercial information.

(f) Failure of the agency to respond
to a notification does not constitute a
finding by the agency that the new dietary ingredient or the dietary supplement that contains the new dietary ingredient is safe or is not adulterated
under section 402 of the act.
